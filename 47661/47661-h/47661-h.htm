<p>The unlimited desire of knowledge which now pervades
every class of Society, suggested the design, of not only
reprinting, without abridgment or curtailment, in a cheap
form, several interesting and valuable Publications, hitherto
placed beyond the reach of a great proportion of readers,
but also of issuing, in that form, many Original Treatises,
by some of the most Distinguished Authors of the age.
Such is the object of the present Work, which is publishing
in a series of Volumes, under the general title of
“<span class="smcap">Constable’s Miscellany of Original and Selected
Publications, in the various Departments of Literature,
Science, and the Arts</span>.”</p>

<p>Immediately after its commencement, in January 1827,
this Miscellany met with extensive encouragement, which
has enabled the Publishers to bring forward a series of
works of the very highest interest, and at unparalleled low
prices. Fifty-two volumes are already before the Public,
forming thirty-four distinct works, any of which may be
purchased separately. Every volume contains a Vignette
Title-page; and numerous other illustrations, such as
Maps, Portraits, &amp;c. are occasionally given.</p>

<p>Being intended for all ages as well as ranks, Constable’s
Miscellany is printed in a style and form which combine
at once the means of giving much matter in a small space,
with the requisites of great clearness and facility.</p>

<p>A Volume, containing at least 324 pages, appears every
three weeks, price 3s. 6d., a limited number being printed
on fine paper, with early impressions of the Vignettes,
price 5s.</p>

<h2><a id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>In presenting to the British Public the Life
of a man, whose name has been for ages the
<i>slogan</i>, or <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cri de guerre</i>, when the liberty of
his country was in danger, few words may
suffice in the way of Preface.</p>

<p>The unprovoked aggression of England
on the freedom of Scotland, produced, in the
latter country, one of those grand national
convulsions, which seldom fail to call forth
some master-spirit from obscurity. Owing
to circumstances, however, connected with
the unsettled and turbulent state of the times,
the transcendent talents of the Knight of Elderslie
had been, among his contemporaries,
more a subject for grateful admiration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
than historical record; and, in consequence,
no small degree of fiction has been mixed up
with his story, while his real achievements
have become in a manner obscured by their
own undefined greatness.</p>

<p>The Proprietors of Constable’s Miscellany,
conceiving that a work exclusively devoted
to the elucidation of the occurrences
in the life and times of the Deliverer of Scotland,
would be an important addition to our
stock of historical knowledge, the writer
was requested to undertake the present work,
having become partially conversant with the
subject, while engaged in drawing up a Life
of Wallace, some years <span class="locked">ago,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span> for the use of
juvenile readers.</p>

<p>In venturing before the Public as the
biographer of the Guardian of Scotland, the
Author is not unconscious of the difficulties
that surround him. The subject is one
with which his countrymen in all ranks of
life have been from their early years more or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">vii</a></span>
less familiar; and are all qualified, to a certain
extent, to become his critics. With so numerous
a host of reviewers, the errors he
may have committed have no chance to
escape detection, while the strong partiality
with which such readers are imbued, will
no doubt be occasionally offended, when
they find the tame realities of historical evidence
substituted for the more pleasing details
of romantic and poetical embellishment.
With another class of readers, whose
cooler temperament and neutralized feelings
may enable them to view the narrative of
our hero’s transactions through a different
medium, the writer runs an equal hazard of
being charged with overstepping the limits
of probability. Thus circumstanced, the
hope of his production meeting any thing
like general approbation becomes extremely
faint, and excites the apprehension that
he will have to measure his success only
by the mildness with which his labours may
be censured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
It remains only to be added, that to <span class="smcap">John
Strachan</span>, Esq. of Thornton, Stirlingshire,
(late of Woodside), the Publishers lie under
deep obligation for the kind manner in
which he furnished information connected
with Wallace’s Oak, and for the sketch of
the tree itself, after a painting by Nasmyth,
executed in 1771, which illustrates the present
Volume. The building, represented in
the back ground, is the ruins of Tor Castle,
where the unfortunate James III. is supposed
to have passed the night previous to the
fatal battle of Sauchie.</p>

<h2><a id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>There is no portion of the history of Scotland
more embarrassing to modern writers, than the period
which relates to the life and achievements of
Wallace.</p>

<p>Having been long since anticipated in all the
leading details respecting him by Henry the Minstrel,
our historians in general seem nervous in approaching
the subject; and have either contented
themselves with such materials as the old English
writers and certain monastic chronicles have furnished,
or have deliberately borrowed, without the
grace of acknowledgment, the facts recorded by
an author they affected to despise, as one whom
the learned were not agreed to admit within the
pale of respectable authority. This treatment,
however, we conceive to be not only unfair,
but rather discourteous in those who may have
extended their suffrages to writers guilty of much
greater aberrations from historical veracity than
any which are chargeable against him. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
true, that the works of those writers are in Latin;
but still, we do not see that a great falsehood, told
in the classical language of ancient Rome, should be
entitled to a larger portion of public faith than a
lesser one set forth in the more modern <i>patois</i> of
Scotland.</p>

<p>When Walsingham, in describing the battle of
Falkirk, tells us that the sharpness and strength
of the English arrows were such, that “they
thoroughly penetrated the men-at-arms, obscured
the helmets, perforated the swords, and overwhelmed
the lances”&mdash;(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ut ipsos armatos omnino
penetrarent, cassides tenebrarent, gladios perforarent,
lanceas funderent</i>)&mdash;and another learned <span class="locked">author,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span>
in narrating the same battle, makes the loss
of the Scots in killed, wounded and prisoners, amount
to more in number than were disposed of
in any one of the most sanguinary conflicts between
the Roman and Barbaric worlds,&mdash;we would
naturally expect, that the indulgence which can
readily attribute such outrages on our credulity,
to the style of the age in which the writers lived,
might also be extended to our Minstrel, even when
he describes his hero “like a true knight-errant,
cleaving his foes through brawn and bayne down
to the shoulders.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
It is said by Lord Hailes, in speaking of Henry,
that “he is an author whom every historian copies,
yet no historian but Sir Robert Sibbald will venture
to quote.” This, though intended as a sneer
by the learned annalist, may be viewed as complimentary
to the candour of Sir Robert, who,
while he avails himself of the facts related by another,
is not above acknowledging the obligation.
Considering the situation of this unfortunate but ingenious
man, no author had ever a stronger claim
on the indulgence of his readers. Blind from his
birth, he was deprived of the advantage of correcting
the manuscript of his work, while his poverty
prevented him from procuring an amanuensis capable
of doing justice to his talents. Hence we
find a number of errors and omissions, that from
the ease with which they can be rectified, appear
evidently the faults of transcribers. Succeeding
historians, far from making the allowance
which his case demanded, have acted towards him
with a degree of peevish hostility exceedingly unbecoming.
Because his dates do not always correspond
with the transactions he records, he has
been termed a “<i>liar</i>” a “<i>fabulist</i>,” “<i>a man blind
in more respects than one</i>;” with other appellations
no less unworthy of themselves than unmerited by
him. When it is considered that there is no circumstance
connected with Wallace mentioned by
subsequent writers, but what had already found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
a place in the work of the Minstrel;&mdash;that they had
no other story to give than what he had previously
given;&mdash;and that they must either repeat what he
had already stated, or remain silent: we are led
to conclude, that he could not have so effectually
pre-occupied the ground, without having very complete
information regarding the subject of his biography.
This information, he tells us himself, was
derived from a memoir written in Latin by John
Blair, assisted by Thomas Gray, the former chaplain
to Wallace, and the latter parson of Liberton,
both eye-witnesses of the transactions they relate.
It follows, therefore, that Scottish authors, having
obtained, in a great measure, their information respecting
Wallace from the pages of Blind Harry,
their characters, as historians, become seriously
involved with the fate of him whom they have so
unceremoniously vituperated. Under these circumstances,
it appears a very proper subject of inquiry,
to ascertain whether he has, or has not executed
his task with becoming fidelity. Were the
memoir of Blair extant, this matter could very soon
be determined; but having long since disappeared,
doubts are now entertained of its ever having
been in existence. Sir Robert Sibbald has published
a few fragments, entitled <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Relationes quædam
Arnaldi Blair, Monachi de Dumfermelini, et
Capellani D. Willielmi Wallas, Militis 1327</i>.
Though these are merely transcripts from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
Scotichronicon of Fordun, yet some have supposed
them to have been the groundwork on which
Blind Harry founded his poem. This opinion, however,
can scarcely be maintained save by those who
have only seen the title; the most superficial inspection
will be sufficient to induce a very different conclusion.
Arnold Blair may have, on some occasion,
officiated as chaplain to Wallace, and, proud of the
distinction, in imitation of his namesake, may have
made the ill-arranged excerpts from Fordun, for
the purpose of handing down his own name in connexion
with that of the illustrious defender of his
country: but the confident manner in which Henry
refers to <i>his</i> author, as evidence of facts which are
not alluded to, even in the most distant manner,
in the work of Arnold, shows the impossibility of
its being the foundation of his narrative; for we
cannot suppose that an author, wishing to pass off
a tissue of fables for a series of truths, would act
with so much inconsistency, as to court detection by
referring for authority to a quarter where he was
sure of finding none. When Henry introduced
his translation to the public, the approbation with
which it was received may very justly be viewed
as the test of its correctness, there being no scarcity
of men in the country capable of collating it with
the original, and detecting the imposition, if any existed;
and it may therefore reasonably be inferred,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
that the excellency of the translation was such as
to supersede the original; being, from its language,
more accessible to all classes than the other, which,
on that account, was more likely to go into desuetude,
and ultimately to disappear.</p>

<p>The character of Minstrel which has been attached
to Henry,&mdash;joined to the vulgar and disgusting
translation of his work into modern Scotch,
by Hamilton of Gilbertfield,&mdash;has, it is presumed,
injured his reputation as a historian, more than any
deviation he has made from the authentic records
of the country. No other work of his exists, or
is known to have existed, which might entitle him
to rank as a minstrel; but being called upon&mdash;and
possibly compelled by circumstances&mdash;to recite his
translation in the presence of the great, he received
a minstrel’s reward, and became, perhaps improperly,
confounded with the profession.</p>

<p>Had Barbour, Wyntown, Langtoft and other
authors, who wrote their chronicles in rhyme,
been quoted by subsequent writers as minstrels,
it would no doubt have weakened their authority
as historians. These men, however, professed to
give, though in verse, a faithful register of the
transactions of their country. Henry seems to have
had only the same object in view; and thus endeavours
to impress the reader with the fidelity of
the translation, and the disinterestedness of his
<span class="locked">motives:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>What more can an author say to satisfy his
reader of the purity of his intentions, as well as
of the genuineness of the source from whence he
has drawn his materials? Without reward, or promise
of reward, he appears to have undertaken his
task from the purest feelings of patriotism, and
finished it before he experienced any of the fostering
influence of patronage. That the transactions
he relates are substantially correct, or at least such
as were generally believed to be so at the time he
wrote, we have the evidence of one nearly cotemporary.
Major thus expresses <span class="locked">himself:<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span> “Henry,
who was blind from his birth, in the time of my
infancy composed <i>the whole Book of William Wallace</i>;
and committed to writing in vulgar poetry,
in which he was well skilled, the <i>things that were
commonly related of him</i>. For my own part, I give
only partial credit to writings of this description. By
the recitation of these however, in the presence of
men of the highest rank, he procured, as he indeed
deserved, food and raiment.” Though Major says
nothing of Blair’s Memoirs, yet he frees Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
from the charge of relating any thing that was not
previously believed by his countrymen.</p>

<p>Thomas Chambers, in his History of the
House of Douglas, says, “These things fell
out in the year 1298; which passages, as the most
part of actions done in the time of Sir William
Wallace, are either passed over, or slenderly touched
by the writers of our chronicles, although the
truth thereof be unquestionable, being related by
those eyewitnesses who wrote the diary or history
of Sir William Wallace in Latin, which is paraphrastically
turned into English rhyme, the interpreter
expressing the main body of the story very
truly; howsomever, missing or mistaking some circumstances,
he differeth therein from the <span class="locked">Latin.”<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span>
From the manner in which this is expressed, it
may be supposed that Chambers had seen the original.
If this could be established, his testimony
would be of considerable importance. Nicholson,
Archdeacon of Carlisle, in his Scottish Historical
Library, says, that the names of the great northern
Englishmen, whom Henry represents Wallace as
having been engaged with, such as Sir Gerard
Heron, Captain Thirlwall, Morland, Martindale,
&amp;c. are still well known on the borders of Cumberland
and Northumberland. The reader may
also find, by the Statistical Account of Scotland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
that the localities mentioned in the poem, are given
with a precision beyond the reach of one labouring
under the infirmity of blindness.</p>

of Irish, at the instigation of Edward, is a circumstance
unnoticed by any historian, save the translator
of Blair; and were it not for the undoubted
evidence, arising from traditions still preserved among
a people who never heard of the work of
the Minstrel, it might be considered as the mere
creation of his own fancy. But such decided testimony
in favour of the correctness of his statement,
when taken in connection with the accurate
manner in which he has described the advance of
Wallace through a country, respecting the intricacies
of which he, of himself, could form no idea&mdash;the
near approach he has made to the Celtic names
of the places, which can still be distinctly traced&mdash;and
the correct description he has given of the
grand scene of action on the Awe,&mdash;are sufficient
to stamp the impress of truth on his narrative,
and satisfy any one of the impossibility of a man,
situated as he was, ever being able to accomplish
it without the diary of an eye-witness.</p>

<p>After the defeat of MacFadyan, Wallace is represented
as holding a council or meeting with the
chieftains of the West Highlands, in the Priory of
Ardchattan. The ruins of the Priory are still to
be found on the banks of Loch Etive, a few miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
from the scene of strife; and among the rubbish,
as well as in the neighbouring grounds, coins of
Edward I. have at different times been dug up, in
considerable quantities. So late as March 1829,
the following paragraph appeared in the Glasgow
Herald:&mdash;“In digging a grave, a few days ago at
Balvodan (or St Modan’s), a burial-place in the
neighbourhood of the Priory of Ardchattan, Argyllshire,
a number of ancient silver coins were
found, in a remarkably fine state of preservation.
The place where they had been deposited was about
four feet below the surface; and they seem to have
been contained in an earthen vessel, which mouldered
into dust, on exposure to the atmosphere;
they were turned up by the shovel, as those who
were attending the interment were surrounding
the grave, and each of the party present having
picked up a few, the rest were, by the Highlanders,
returned with the earth to the grave. The
coins were struck in the reign of the First Edward,
whose name can be distinctly traced on them; and
they were probably placed there at the time, when
that monarch had succeeded in getting temporary
possession of the greater part of Scotland. In that
case they must have lain where they were found for
upwards of five hundred years.” The writer had
an opportunity of examining a number of these
coins on the spot; he found a great many of them to
be struck in Dublin, and they seemed below the regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
standard. Though numerous discoveries have
been made of the coins of this ambitious monarch
in other parts of Scotland, yet in the West Highlands
they are extremely rare. Neither Edward,
nor any of his English generals, ever penetrated
so far in that direction. It is, therefore, highly
probable, that the above money may have formed
part of the contents of the military chest of MacFadyan,
which, in that superstitious age, had found
its way into the hands of the priesthood.</p>

<p>Although Henry cannot be collated with his original,
the truth or falsehood of his narrative may, in
part, be ascertained by comparing him with those
who preceded him on the same subject. The most
reputable of these writers, and those whose characters
for veracity stand highest in the estimation of
the learned, are John de Fordun, and Andro de
Wyntown, both original historians; for, though
Wyntown outlived Fordun, he had not an opportunity
of seeing his history. With respect to Fordun’s
agreement with the Minstrel, the reader has
the evidence of Nicholson, Archdeacon of Carlisle,
who says, that “Hart’s <i>edition</i> of Wallace
contains a preface which confirms the whole of it
out of the <span class="locked">Scoti-Chronicon.”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span> Wyntown, who finished
his history in 1424, being about 46 years
before Henry, in alluding to those deeds of Wallace
which he had left <i>unrecorded</i>, says,</p>

<p>The first couplet may allude to Blair’s Diary, or
perhaps to Fordun’s History, which he had no doubt
heard of; and, in the succeeding lines, he doubts
that, however much may have been recorded, it must
still fall very short of what was actually performed.
This is so far satisfactory, from one who lived almost
within a century of the time, and who no
doubt often conversed with those whose fathers
had fought under the banners of Wallace; it is a
pity that his modesty, and his want of “gud laysere,”
prevented him from devoting more of his
time to so meritorious a subject. The first transaction
which he has narrated, is the affair at Lanark;
but it is evident from what he says, that
Wallace must have often before mingled in deadly
feud with the English soldiers, and done them serious
injury; otherwise, it would be difficult to
account for their entertaining towards him the degree
of animosity expressed in the following lines:</p>

<p>Every particular that Wyntown gives of the conflict
which ensues, in consequence of this preconcerted
quarrel on the part of the English, is detailed
in the account of the Minstrel with a degree
of correctness, leaving no room to doubt that either
the two authors must have drawn their materials
from the same source, or that Henry, having
heard Wyntown’s version of the story, considered it
so near the original as to leave little to be corrected.
The language, as will be seen from the following
examples, is nearly the same:</p>

<p>The similarity of Henry’s version is too apparent
to be the effect of chance. After a little <i>badinage</i>,
which does not appear in Wyntown, he
says,</p>

<p>The parties soon come to blows; and, in the
conflict, Wallace cut off the hand of one of his
opponents. Wyntown thus takes notice of the
circumstance.</p>

<p>The escape of Wallace by means of his mistress&mdash;her
murder by order of the sheriff&mdash;his return
the ensuing night&mdash;with the slaughter of the
sheriff&mdash;are particularly taken notice of by Wyntown.
Henry’s translation includes all these occurrences,
and only differs by being more circumstantial.
The account of the battle of Falkirk
agrees in numerous instances. The covenant between
Cumming and Bruce, which Henry states
to have taken place near Stirling, is corroborated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
in place and circumstance by Fordun, Wyntown
and Barbour. The hanging of Sir Bryce Blair
and Sir Ronald Crawford in a barn at Ayr, is
confirmed by the last mentioned writer, although
he does not descend to particulars.</p>

<p>These, and many other instances may be adduced,
to show, that, though Henry or his authority
may have occasionally indulged in the marvellous,
yet the general outline of his history, and
even many of the particulars, are in strict accordance
with truth; and the work itself necessarily becomes
not only valuable as a depository of ancient manners,
but as containing matter, which, if properly investigated,
may be useful to the historian. Whether
the apocryphal part&mdash;and which, it must be
allowed, is considerable&mdash;ought to be attributed to
the fancy of the translator, or if it formed a portion
of the original text, we have no means of
ascertaining. From the frequent and apparent sincerity,
however, with which Henry appeals to his
“auctor,” and the value he seems to attach to a
faithful discharge of his task, we might be led to
infer, that if it were practicable to collate his performance
with the memoir of Blair, the rendering
of it would be found unexceptionable. Under
these circumstances, the writer of the following
narrative has not scrupled to avail himself of such
statements as appeared entitled to credit; and,
though he cannot consider the Minstrel as deserving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
the same degree of confidence as Wyntown
or Barbour, yet, when he finds him consistent and
characteristic, he conceives it would be unjust to
suspect falsehood in every instance, where he does
not happen to be supported by the respectable
testimonies already enumerated. That he is more
circumstantial than any of the Scottish historians,
is easily accounted for, by his attention, or rather
that of his author, being engrossed by the actions
of one individual. A degree of minuteness is in
this case adopted, which would be altogether incompatible
with the plan of a general historian.</p>

<p>These remarks it has been deemed necessary to
make in defence of one to whom we are indebted
for the only original memoir of the greatest hero,
and purest patriot, Scotland or any other country
ever produced; an author, however, who, instead
of having the merits of his work fairly appreciated,
has been vilified and abused by those who,
in their zeal for establishing new historical creeds,
have found it a matter of less labour to <i>sneer</i> than
to <i>investigate</i>.</p>

<p>The sources from whence the present writer
has drawn his materials, will, it is hoped, be found
such as are generally entitled to credit. Being of opinion
that the authors who lived nearest the period
under review ought to be best informed respecting
the transactions connected with it, he has therefore
endeavoured to collate as many ancient Scottish and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
English authorities as possible. The biographical
notices of such Englishmen as figured in the Scottish
wars, are chiefly drawn from the historians of
England; conceiving that it belongs to the writers
of a country to be best acquainted with the details
of its internal and domestic history; but to enumerate
the authorities he has consulted, would
here be superfluous, as they are duly noted at the
proper stages of the narrative.</p>

<span class="subhead">STATE OF SCOTLAND IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY.</span></h2>

<p>The scanty and imperfect records which exist
respecting the early state of Scotland, have been
a fruitful source of complaint to all writers who
have applied themselves to the investigation of her
history. Those, however, who would form an estimate
of her relative situation and internal resources,
by reference to her condition at the time
she became allied to England on the accession of
James VI., would arrive at very erroneous conclusions
on the subject.</p>

<p>That Scotland retrograded under the dynasty
of the Stuarts, few, who are conversant with her
early history, will be inclined to deny. But, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
inquiring how far the incapacity or imprudence
of that unfortunate race may have contributed
to her decline, the writer will endeavour to
arrange a few remarks respecting the above-mentioned
period, for the benefit of those readers whose
attention may not have been directed to that interesting
portion of our annals.</p>

<p>The jurisprudence of Scotland, like that of the other
states of Europe, embraced the feudal system
in all its degrees of servitude, from the knightly devoirs
of the baron, down to the humble and more
laborious task of the bondsman, who could be either
put to death at the will of his over-lord, or
bartered away to the church, for a certain number
of masses. Yet though this state of society existed
to a considerable extent, there were some privileged
classes exempt from its more degrading operation.
The most influential of these, as might
be expected, were the priesthood, who, as soon as
admitted to orders, became emancipated from their
temporal <span class="locked">bondage.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span></p>

<p>Merchants and burgesses were of course free.
Had this not been the case, those useful classes
could not have existed, as the control of the
feudal superior over the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">adscriptos glebæ</i>, extended
not only to an absolute property in themselves
and their offspring, but also over any means
they might accumulate. When a bondsman, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
bought a burgage, and remained a year and a
day in a burgh, without being molested or claimed
by his lord, he became a free man for <span class="locked">ever.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span></p>

<p>Another useful portion of society is to be found
in our records under the name of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">liberi firmarii</i>,
or free yeomanry, the formation of which, it is
presumed, may be attributed in a great measure
to the ecclesiastical establishments. The clergy,
from their superior education, were wiser, in their
generation, than their neighbours; and instead of allowing
the produce of their lands to be eaten up by
hordes of idle serfs, they preferred letting them at
a valuation to industrious free men, whom they encouraged
by the immunities which they had it in
their power to grant. These free men were generally
the descendants of the clergy, the younger
sons of gentlemen, or burgesses possessed of small
capitals. From this judicious management, the
church lands were always the best cultivated, and
consequently the most productive in the country.</p>

<p>At an early period the maritime towns were frequented
by foreigners; and the productions of almost
every clime were to be found in Scotland.
By an Act of Alexander <span class="locked">III.,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span> it appears that
the trade of the country had rather declined during
his minority; the causes of which are stated
to have been, captures by pirates, shipwrecks on
the coast, storms at sea, and detentions on slight
grounds in various ports and places. In order,
therefore, to revive the foreign commerce of the
kingdom, and give the necessary security and facility
to transactions with strangers, all the lieges were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
strictly prohibited from interfering with the said
traffic, except the burgesses at the different ports.
This regulation gave confidence to foreigners,
by bringing them into immediate contact with a
description of men, with whom reciprocal advantages
would naturally beget and maintain a friendly
<span class="locked">understanding.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span></p>

<p>The consequence of this liberal policy was soon
felt; and before the year expired, vessels from all
quarters made their appearance in the Scottish harbours,
willing to exchange their cargoes for the
productions of the country; and in the course of
a few years, Scotland exhibited a very flourishing
appearance, abounding in money and wealth of
every description. The Flemings, whom the English
had expelled, found protection and encouragement
in Scotland, and were allowed to fortify their
factory at Berwick, called “The Red Hall,” under
condition of their defending it to the last extremity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
against the enemies of that kingdom. This engagement,
as will be seen, they afterwards nobly
performed.</p>

<p>A number of wealthy Lombards, jealous perhaps
of their rivals the Flemings, now made application
to the Government of Scotland for permission
to erect similar establishments in various parts of
the country, particularly at Queensferry and other
stations on the Forth,&mdash;craving, at the same time,
certain spiritual privileges. The States of the kingdom
acceded at once to their request, in so far as
they regarded trade; but as the Lombards were the
vassals of the Pope, they prudently declined mixing
up any ecclesiastical matters with affairs of commerce.
In the meantime, the unfortunate death of the King
put an end to the negociation. Fordun, who narrates
the circumstance, does not condescend on the
nature of the spiritual privileges required. It is
highly probable, however, that they consisted in
their being admitted into Scotland on the same
terms which they enjoyed in England and other European
states, where they were recognised in a
special manner as “the Pope’s merchants,” and
were intrusted by him with the receiving and remitting
the immense revenues which were drawn
from every country where their Holy Father’s supremacy
was acknowledged. Trade, with them,
was often a secondary consideration. Lending of
money, for which they exacted enormous usury,
constituted the most lucrative part of their operations;
and in these nefarious transactions, it has
been conjectured, that they were often commissioned
to employ the funds belonging to the Holy
See, whose bulls were frequently issued in their
favour, when their crimes or rapacity had aroused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
the vengeance of the governments under which
they <span class="locked">resided.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span> Their severity to their debtors,
made them known by the name of <i>Caursini</i>; and
they at last became generally obnoxious for their
extortion. If the account given of them by Matthew
Paris may be relied on, the caution of the
Scots respecting the admission of such harpies into
the country was highly commendable.</p>

<p>The great mart for foreign commerce in the
kingdom, previous to 1296, appears to have been
Berwick. The importance of this place was considerable.
Even in the reign of Malcolm IV., it
possessed more ships than any other town in Scotland,
and was exposed, from its wealth, to visits
from the piratical fleets of the Norwegians. In
1156, a ship belonging to a citizen, called Knut
the Opulent, and having his wife on board, was
taken by Erlend, Earl of Orkney; but it is recorded
Knut hired fourteen ships, with a competent
number of men, for which he paid one
hundred merks of silver, and went in pursuit of
the pirate, who had anchored for the night at
one of the adjacent <span class="locked">islands.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span></p>

<p>The wealth and importance of this ancient emporium
of commerce, became so great in the reign
of Alexander II., as to excite the admiration of
contemporary authors, one of whom calls it a
“second Alexandria;” and eulogizes the inhabitants
for the extent of their donations to religious
houses. “But we have,” says Macpherson,
in his Annals of Commerce, “better authority
than the voice of panegyric, for the prosperity
of Berwick; as we find the customs of it assigned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
by King Alexander to a merchant of Gascoigne
for 2,197<i>l.</i> 8s. Sterling&mdash;a sum equal to 32,961
bolls of wheat, at the usual price of 16 <span class="locked">pennies.”<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span></p>

<p>In the years 1283 and 1284, Robert Durham
the Mayor, together with Simon Martel, and other
good men of Berwick, enacted the <i>Statute of
the Gilt</i>.</p>

<p>“By c. 20. None but gild-brothers were permitted
to buy hides, wool, or wool-fells, in order
to sell them again, or cut cloth, except foreign
merchants.</p>

<p>“C. 22. 37. and 44. Herrings and other fish,
corn, beans, peas, salt, and <span class="locked">coals,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span> were ordered
to be sold ‘<i>at the bray</i>,’ along side the vessel
bringing them, and no where else; and they were
not to be carried on shore when the sun was
down. Any burgess who was present at a purchase
of herrings, might claim a portion of them
for his own consumption, at the original cost.</p>

<p>“C. 28. No regrator was allowed to buy fish,

twenty-four councillors,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>In 1283, when Edward was preparing for his
invasion of Wales, he commissioned one John
Bishop, a burgess of Lynne, to purchase merchandise
(<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">mercimonia</i>) for him in Scotland. This is
rather a singular instance of the superiority of the
Scots market in those <span class="locked">days.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span></p>

<p>The other cities in Scotland, though inferior to
Berwick, were not without their proportion of
trade. About the same time, the sheriffs of Cumberland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
and Lancaster were ordered to send people
to purchase fish on the west coast of Scotland,
and convey them to the <i>depôt</i> at Chester; and one
Adam de Fulcham was commissioned to furnish
100 barrels of sturgeons, of 500 weight each, 5000
salt fish, also dried fish. The fish of Aberdeen
were so well cured, that they were exported to
the principal fishing port of Yarmouth.</p>

<p>Four hundred fish of Aberdeen (perhaps salmon),
one barrel sturgeons, five dozen lampreys,
fifty pounds whale oil, <i>balen</i> (for burning, perhaps,
during the voyage), and a half last of herrings,
constituted the fish part of the provisions put on
board of a ship fitted out at Yarmouth for bringing
the infant Queen of Scotland from the court
of her father, the King of Norway. The fish of
Aberdeen cost somewhat under three pennies;
stock-fish under one penny each, and the half last
of herring <span class="locked">30s.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span></p>

<p>In the reign of Alexander III., the merchants
of St Omer’s, and partners of the Florentine
houses of Pullici and Lambini, had established
correspondents in Scotland; and one Richard de
Furbur, a trader of the inland town of Roxburgh,
had sent factors and supercargoes to manage his
business in foreign countries, and various parts of
Britain.</p>

<p>The exports of Scotland, at this time, consisted
of wool and woolfells, hides, black <span class="locked">cattle,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span> fish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
salted and cured, horses, greyhounds, falcons,
pearls, and herrings, particularly those caught in
Lochfyne, which had a preference, and found a
ready market among the French, who came and
exchanged their wines at a place still known by
the name of <i>French Foreland</i>; and so much was
wine a regular understood barter, that Lochfyne
(<i>Lochfion</i>), or the Wine Loch, became the only
name for one of the most extensive arms of the
Western Ocean on the Scottish coast. The pearl
was a more ancient branch of traffic, and said to
have been in request among the Romans. The
Scottish pearl, however, appears to have been partially
superseded in the French market, by the introduction
of an article of superior lustre from the
East. The goldsmiths of Paris, therefore, made
a trade regulation, forbidding any worker in gold
or silver to set any Scotch pearls along with Oriental
ones, except in large jewels for churches.
The <span class="locked">greyhounds,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span> however, kept up their price;
and the Scottish falcons were only rivalled by those
of Norway.</p>

<p>The reader may have some idea of the quantity
of wine consumed at the table of Alexander III.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
from the circumstance of one hundred and seventy-eight
hogsheads being supplied in the year 1263,
and sixty-seven hogsheads and one pipe furnished
the following year. The difference in the quantity
of these two years may have been occasioned by
the battle of Largs having taken place on the 2d
October 1263; after which there would, no doubt,
be a considerable influx of barons and their followers
to the royal presence, to partake of the festivities
incident to the <span class="locked">occasion.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span></p>

<p>Horses were, it is said, an article of importation
as well as exportation with the Scots in the
thirteenth century. Alexander I. rode a fine Arabian;
and, in the Norwegian account of Haco’s invasion,
we are told that a large body of Scottish
knights appeared on Spanish steeds, which were
completely armed. It is probable, however, that
the warriors so mounted might have been the
forces of the Temple, as this wealthy order had
been some time before established in the country;
and its services would no doubt be required on so
stirring an occasion.</p>

<p>Asia, in the thirteenth century, was the grand
military school for the nations of Europe; and
every country having representatives in the armies
of the crusaders, the improvements that took
place in the art of war were quickly transfused
through the various kingdoms of Christendom;
and the offensive and defensive armour of each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
was, therefore, nearly the same. The warriors of
Scotland and England assimilated very closely to
each other; and, with the exception, perhaps, of
the glaive-men and the bill-men of the English, and
the Highlanders and Isles-men of the Scots, no material
difference could be discovered. The Scots,
as well as the English, had “men-at-arms,” who
fought on foot; and while the latter used the lance,
the former were armed with a spear of no common
length. These men among the Scots were selected
on account of their stature and strength, and were
generally placed in the front-rank of the squares,
being completely enclosed in defensive armour,
which consisted of steel helmets, a tunic, stuffed
with wool, tow, or old cloth, with a habergeon,
or shirt of iron rings, the joints defended by
plates of the same metal. The stubbornness with
which they maintained their ranks may very reasonably
be supposed to have acquired for the Scottish
phalanx or schiltron, that high character for
firmness and obstinate valour for which it was so
long distinguished.</p>

<p>Hauberks of different kinds, with padded or
quilted pourpoints, having iron rings set edgeways,
were generally worn. In the early part of the
reign of Alexander III, chain-mail was first introduced
into Scotland by the crusaders; it was formed
of four rings, joined to a fifth, and all firmly
secured by rivets. Eastern armour, however,
had appeared in the country before this period, as
we find that Alexander I. had a splendid suit of
Arabian manufacture, richly ornamented with
jewels, with a spear and shield of silver, which,
along with his Arabian steed, covered with a fair
mantle of fine velvet, and other rich housings, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
dedicated to the patron Saint of Scotland, within
the church of St Andrew’s, in the early part of the
thirteenth century. This was considered so valuable
a donation, as to require the sanction of David,
the heir-apparent of the <span class="locked">throne.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span></p>

<p>Habergeons, of various forms and dimensions,
according to the fancy or circumstances of the
wearer, prevailed in this age. These were generally
covered by a gown or tabard, on the back
and front of which the arms of the wearer were
emblazoned. Jacked or boiled leather, with quilted
iron-work, was also in use for defending the
arms and legs. Helmets, bacinets and skullcaps,
surmounted, according to the dignity of the person,
formed defences for the head; and the shields
were either round, triangular, or kite-shape, with
the device or arms of the warrior painted upon
them in glaring colours. The common soldiers
wrapped pieces of cloth about the neck, their numerous
folds of which formed an excellent defence
from the cut of a sword. The “<i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">Ridir</i>,” or
Knight among the Highlanders, differed little in
his equipment from those of the same rank in
the Low Country. In battle, he was usually
attended by a number of <i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">Gall-oglaich</i>. These were
soldiers selected as the stoutest and bravest of the
clan, and might be considered as the “men-at-arms”
among the Gaël. They were supplied either
with the corslet, or the <i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">lùireach mhailleach</i>, (the
habergeon, literally the coat of rings,) and were armed
with the Lochaber-axe, the <i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">clamdhmhor</i>, (great
two-handed sword) and sometimes a heavy shelving
stone-axe, beautifully polished, and fixed into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
a strong shaft of <span class="locked">oak.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span> In the rear of the <i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">Gall-oglaich</i>,
stood the <i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">Ceatharnaich</i>, an inferior sort of
soldiers, armed with knives and daggers. Their
duty was to take, kill, or disable those whom the
prowess of the front rank had brought to the ground.
The boldest and most dexterous among the <i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">Gall-oglaich</i>
was made squire or armour-bearer to the
chief. This man, as well as the rest of his companions,
received a larger portion of victuals when
they sat at their leader’s table; but the part allotted
for the armour-bearer was greater than any,
and called, on that account, <i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">beath fir</i>, or, “the
Champion’s Meal.”</p>

<p>Among the Knights of the Isles, the conical-shaped
helmet was more in use than any other.
From piratical habits, and long intercourse with
the Norwegians, their followers in general were
better equipped than those of the mainland. The
habergeon was very common among them; and
from the gown they put over it, being universally
dyed of a yellow or saffron-colour, they presented
a more uniform appearance than their neighbours.</p>

<p>Besides the lance and spear, the mace, the pike,
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">martel de fer</i> (a sort of iron hammer), the two-handed
sword, various forms of daggers, knives,
clubs, flails, scythes fixed on poles, bows, <span class="locked">cross-bows,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span>
and slings made by a thong fixed to the end
of a staff, were in use among the Scots. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
slingers used their weapons with both hands. They
had no defensive armour, and were generally placed
among the archers, who were divided into companies
of twenty-five men each.</p>

<p>The military engines in use in attacking or defending
castles, or other fortified places, were the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Loup de Guerre</i>, or war-wolf, a frame formed of
heavy beams, with spikes, and made to fall on the
assailants in the manner of a portcullis&mdash;the
<i>Scorpion</i>, a large stationary cross-bow of steel,
which discharged darts of an uncommon size, and
the <i>Balista</i>, <i>Catapulta</i>, and <i>Trebuchet</i>, which were
engines of great power in throwing large stones,
which were often heated to a high temperature.
The <i>Bricolle</i> threw large square-headed darts,
called <i>Carreaux</i>, or <i>Quarrels</i>. This engine was
used by the Flemings in fortifying their factory
at Berwick, called the “Red Hall.” The <i>Espringal</i>
threw darts with brass plates, instead of feathers,
to make their flight steady. The <i>Berfrarium</i>,
an engine also called <i>Belfredus</i>, was
made of wood, covered with skins to defend it
from fire, and was formed like a tower, and of a
height to overlook the walls. It consisted of several
stories, and was rolled on wheels towards
the object of attack, and filled with archers and
spearmen; the latter, under cover of the former,
either rushed upon the walls, or fought hand to
hand with the besieged. The name was afterwards
given to high towers erected in cities, for
the purpose of alarming by bells. Hence the origin
of the term “Belfrey.” The most expert in
the manufacture of these engines of destruction
was a monk of Durham. This man supplied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
greatest portion of the artillery required for the
defence of Berwick.</p>

<p>Respecting the state of the Arts, it would be
difficult to give any thing like a circumstantial detail.
That various useful mechanical professions
were known and prosecuted, there is abundance
of evidence to prove; but to what degree of perfection
they were brought, is not so clear. That
the compass was familiar to the mariners of Scotland
at an early age, appears from the manner in
which Barbour expresses himself, in the description
of Bruce and his companions, who, in crossing
from Arran to Carrick in the night-time, steered
by the light of a fire upon the shore.</p>

<p>If the beautiful specimens of architecture which
were produced in this age may be regarded
as furnishing certain criteria for judging of the
general state of the arts, we would be warranted
in assigning to them a much higher degree
of perfection than many of our readers would be
inclined to admit. It is, however, difficult to believe,
that a nation could have arrived at a high
degree of excellence in an art which required a
superior knowledge of the principles of science, as
well as the greatest refinement in taste, without
having made a corresponding proficiency in those
of a subordinate character. The exquisite workmanship
which adorned the crosses and monuments
within the sacred precincts of the Island
of Iona, commands at once the admiration and respect
of strangers; and the fragments which have
escaped the ravages of modern Vandalism, display
a neatness of execution in the figures, lettering
and embellishments, which may justly claim competition
with the productions of the present day.
Some, who will not look further than the subsequent
poverty and degradation of Scotland, insist
that these crosses and monuments are French manufacture,
and were imported from France. This
conjecture will not admit of a moment’s reflection.
They might as well inform us that the
Abbey of Melrose, the Cathedral of Glasgow, and
all the rest of our sacred edifices, were importations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
from the same quarter. With more propriety,
however, it may be alleged, that the most
elegant of our Ecclesiastical structures were erected
by a band of ingenious architects and workmen
belonging to various countries, who associated together
about this time, under the name of Free
Masons, and wandered about Europe, offering
their services where they expected the most liberal
encouragement. Of these men, it is presumed
Scotland has a right to claim a fair proportion.</p>

<p>Naval architecture also appears to have met
with due encouragement; for we find, in the year
1249, Hugh de Chantillon, Earl of St Paul and de
Blois, a powerful vassal of Louis IX., joined the
crusaders under that monarch at Cyprus, with fifty
knights carrying banners, besides a numerous body
of Flemings, on board of a vessel of great strength
and dimensions, which, according to Matthew
<span class="locked">Paris,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></span> (who calls it a marvellous vessel), was
built at Inverness, in the Murray Firth. On this
occasion Macpherson <span class="locked">remarks,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></span> “That a French
nobleman should apply to the carpenters of Inverness
for a ship, is a curious circumstance; which
seems to infer, that they had acquired such a degree
of reputation in their profession, as to be celebrated
in foreign countries.” A large vessel
was afterwards built for the Venetians at the same
<span class="locked">place.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></span></p>

<p>The law of Scotland is known to all to have
been that of the Romans. The municipal and
commercial departments were under the control
of the Court of the “Four Burghs,” which consisted
of representatives from Berwick, Edinburgh,
Roxburgh and Stirling; to whom all matters connected
with commerce, and the rights and privileges
of the burgesses, were referred. The Chamberlain’s
Court had also a jurisdiction over the
burghs in matters respecting the trade and general
policy of the kingdom. The chamberlain, in
the discharge of his duty, was constrained to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
periodical progress through the kingdom, to adjust
the standards, weights and measures, kept in
the different burghs. It was also his duty to detect
any imposition that might be practised by the
King’s servants, in exacting more goods at the
King’s price (which was lower than the market),
than what were required for his service, and thereby
making a profit to themselves. From the regulations
of the Chamberlain’s Court, it appears
that inspectors were appointed to examine and
certify, by their seal of office, the quantity and
quality of cloth, bread, and casks containing liquors;
and that other officers, called “Troners,”
had the inspection of wool. Salmon fishings
also were carefully regulated; and fishing during
the night, or while the salmon were not in
season, was <span class="locked">prohibited.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span></p>

<p>The great councils of the nation, from whence
all the laws emanated, had their meetings at Scone;
and the promulgation of any new act was preceded
by the ringing of the great bell of the monastery
where the meetings were held. By this practice,
“the bell of Scoon” became, in time, a cant
expression for the law of the <span class="locked">land.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></span> These councils
were almost solely attended by the barons
and ecclesiastics of the highest rank. Neither
merchants nor burgesses were admitted. Representations,
therefore, from the Chamberlain’s Court,
and the Court of the Four Burghs, afforded the
only chance for correcting the mistakes which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
might arise from the ignorance of these aristocratic
legislators.</p>

<p>From the intercourse which existed between
Scotland and England during the long interval of
peace, previous to the aggression of Edward, the
manners, particularly of the higher classes, were
in many respects nearly the same. The frequent
intermarriages tended, more than any other cause,
to render the inhabitants of the two countries familiar
with the habits and customs of each other,
while both imitated the French in dress and language;
and their domestic economy, in numerous
instances, also bore a close resemblance.</p>

<p>Though the barons and churchmen among the
Scots had no taste for the high-spiced wines so
much relished by the English, yet in the viands
which graced their festivities, particularly those
who held lands in England, there appeared to have
been little or no alteration. On great occasions,
the seal, the porpoise, and the wild boar, though
now banished from the table, never failed to make
their appearance. Venison pasties, game, poultry,
and baked meats of all descriptions, with fish in
endless variety, were common at the tables of the
great. Shell-fish, particularly oysters, were much
in demand among the ecclesiastics. This is evident
from the quantity of shells which are still to
be found in digging about the ruins of religious
establishments. The frequent recurrence of those
periods when food of an opposite description was
forbidden, sufficiently accounts for this profusion.</p>

<p>Among the culinary preparations that were peculiar
to Scotland, one known by the name of
<i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">Mìr-Mòr</i>, was held in the highest estimation.
This savoury dish always had a place at the royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
table; and so much was it a favourite, that in the
traditionary songs of the Gaëlic bards, it is mentioned
as a viand fit only for a hero, and represented
by them to be given as such by Fingal to
his friend <i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">Goll Mac-mhairn</i>, in addition to his
<i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">beath fir</i>, or “champion’s meal,” which he received
sitting at the right hand of the royal donor.
Of this highly-prized <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">morceau friand</i>, minced
meat, marrow and herbs, were the principal ingredients;
and in this composition it is not difficult
to trace the origin of the “Haggies,” a dish
still considered national among the Scots.</p>

<p>Were it a fair criterion to estimate the strength
and importance of a country by the princely revenues
of its church establishment, Scotland, in the
thirteenth century, might be considered as holding
a very respectable rank among the nations of Europe.
The deference which the Roman Pontiffs,
on various occasions, paid to the Kings of Scotland,
while it displayed their anxiety to preserve,
by conciliatory conduct, the spiritual supremacy in
the kingdom, also shows that the national or patriotic
feelings of the Scottish ecclesiastics were
stronger than those ties which connected them
with the See of Rome; for, by their well-timed
support of the royal authority, the thunders of the
Vatican, so terrible in other countries, rolled harmlessly
over without distracting the state; and the
King was often enabled to contest, and bring to a
favourable termination, those differences which arose
between him and the Pope, with whose legates
he frequently assumed very high ground, not
only forbidding them his presence, but even refusing
them a safe conduct through his dominions.</p>

<p>To give any thing like a satisfactory account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
the revenues of the several ecclesiastical endowments,
would occupy a space not consistent with
the design of the present work. It may, however,
be briefly stated, that the wealth of the church did
not altogether arise from her spiritual emoluments.
Agriculture, and various branches of traffic, engaged
the attention, and increased the riches as well as
the luxuries of the priesthood. In 1254 the Cistercian
monks were the greatest breeders of sheep
in England. Being exempted from duties, their
wealth rapidly increased. That they possessed
similar privileges in Scotland, is pretty evident;
for in <span class="locked">1275,<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span> when Bagamont, an emissary from
Rome, was sent to levy a tenth on the property
of the Scottish church for the relief of the Holy
Land, this wealthy order of temporal as well as
spiritual shepherds, compounded for the enormous
sum of 50,000 merks. By this compromise, the
amount of their revenues remained unknown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
The following is part of the live-stock, which
(according to an inventory preserved in the chartulary
of Newbottle) at one time belonged to the
Abbey of Melrose, viz. 325 forest mares, 54 domestic
mares, 104 domestic horses, 207 stags
or young horses, 39 three-year old colts, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
172 year old colts. Amidst all this profusion
of wealth, the serious reader may desire to know
how the ceremonials of religion were attended
to. From the many jokes which Fordun relates
as having taken place among the clergy of his
day, we cannot suppose that either the teachers
or the people were more devout than their
neighbours. An old writer describes the interior
of a cathedral as a place where the men came
with their hawks and dogs, walking to and fro, to
converse with their friends, to make bargains and
appointments, and to show their guarded coats;
and among the Scots, it is well known, weapons
were too often displayed on such occasions.</p>

<p>From what has been stated in the foregoing
pages, it is pretty evident that Scotland occupied
a more prominent station among the nations of
Europe, before the aggression of Edward I. than
she has ever done since. The single fact, that Alexander
II. mustered and led to the borders of England,
in 1244, an army of 100,000 foot, with a well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
appointed body of cavalry, proves that, at the period
under review, when the numerical strength of the
two British kingdoms were marshalled, the inferiority
of Scotland was by no means very apparent.
An army so numerous as that we have mentioned,
no subsequent monarch of that kingdom ever had
it in his power to bring into the field. On the
death of Alexander III. the prosperity of Scotland
became eclipsed&mdash;anarchy overspread the
land&mdash;the machiavelism of her arch-enemy prevailed&mdash;her
ancient glory was trampled in the
dust&mdash;and commerce deserted a country overrun
with the horrors of war. Thus, in the emphatic
language of the Bard, “Oure gold wes changyd
into lede;” “and,” says MacPherson, “our
fishermen and merchants into cut-throats and plunderers,
whose only trade was war, and whose precarious
and only profit was the ruin of her neighbours.”</p>

<span class="subhead">ON THE CLAIM OF ENGLAND TO THE FEUDAL HOMAGE OF SCOTLAND.</span></h2>

<p>Scotland, at various periods of her history, has
been placed in situations of imminent peril, from
the encroachments and invasions of her ambitious
neighbour in the South. Misled by an insatiable
thirst for conquest, the English monarchs were
either prosecuting their views of aggrandizement
on the continent of Europe, or disturbing the tranquillity
of Britain by endeavouring to subvert the
liberty and independence of her states. The
Welsh, after being driven from the most fruitful
of their domains, continued an arduous, but ineffectual
struggle for their freedom, amid the few
barren rocks and vallies that remained to them of
their ancient and once flourishing kingdom. The
Scots, though always numerically inferior to the
English, and, from the comparative poverty of
their country, deficient in those internal resources
which their richer neighbours possessed; yet, from
their warlike propensities, their parsimonious habits,
and that love of independence which formed
so striking a feature in the character of all the tribes
of which the nation was composed, were either
prepared to guard the frontier of their kingdom, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
retaliate an aggression by invading the territories
of the enemy. This last measure was the mode
of defence they chiefly resorted to; aware that,
with the exception of Berwick, the English, without
advancing farther into the country than was
consistent with their safety, would find no booty
equivalent to what could be driven by the Scots
from the fertile plains of their more wealthy opponents.
These hostilities were frequently embittered
by a claim of superiority which the English
urged against the crown and kingdom of
Scotland; and as the attempts which were made,
from time to time, to enforce it, have produced
more misery and bloodshed than any other national
quarrel that ever existed between the two
countries, an inquiry into the nature and foundation
of the alleged plea of vassalage, may be of
importance in elucidating the conduct of the conflicting
parties in the following narrative. In this
inquiry, we shall dispense with any reference,
either to “Brute the Trojan” on the one side,
or to that no less questionable personage, “Scota,
daughter to the King of Egypt,” on the other; and
proceed, at once, to the only well-authenticated
evidence that exists on the subject.</p>

<p>In the year 1174, William, King of Scotland,
dissatisfied with the conduct of Henry II. of England,
invaded Northumberland, instigated thereto
by a sense of his own wrongs, real or imaginary,
and those discontented barons who wished
to place the young King on the throne,&mdash;an
ambitious youth, whom his father had imprudently
allowed to be crowned during his own lifetime.
While the numerous army of William was spread
over the adjacent country, wasting, burning, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
slaying with that indiscriminate recklessness peculiar
to the age; he, with a chosen band of his followers,
besieged the Castle of Alnwick. The devastations
committed by the marauding army of the
Scots inflamed the minds of the Barons of Yorkshire
with a generous indignation; and they determined
to exert themselves for the relief of their distressed
countrymen. Having congregated at
Newcastle to the number of four hundred horsemen,
encased in heavy armour; they, though already
fatigued with a long journey, pressed forward
under the command of Sir Bernard de Baliol;
and, by travelling all night, came in sight of the
battlements of Alnwick Castle by daybreak. William,
it would seem, had been abroad in the fields,
with a slender escort of sixty horse; and, mistaking
the English for a detachment of his own troops,
he was too far advanced to retire, before he became
sensible of his danger. “Now it will be seen who
are true knights,” said the intrepid monarch, and
instantly charged the enemy. His efforts, however,
were unavailing; he was soon overpowered,
and, along with his companions, made prisoner.</p>

<p>The chivalry of Yorkshire thus secured for their
monarch a valuable prize. The magnanimity of
Henry, however, was not equal to the gallantry of
his subjects; for, on getting possession of the unfortunate
prince, he inflicted on him every possible
mortification. Not satisfied with exhibiting his
rival, like a felon, with his feet tied under his horse’s
belly, to the rude gaze of the vulgar; he summoned
all his barons to Northampton, to witness “the humiliating
spectacle of a sovereign prince exposed
in public to a new-invented <span class="locked">indignity.”<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
It may appear difficult to account for this treatment
of a Royal Captive, taken under such circumstances,
in an age when the honours of chivalry
were eagerly sought after by all the crowned heads
of Europe. When we reflect, however, that on
the Thursday preceding the capture of William,
Henry himself had been ignominiously scourged
at the tomb of his formidable enemy, Thomas à
Becket, his lacerated feelings might, perhaps,
have found some relief in this public exhibition
of his power to inflict, on a brother monarch, something
of a similar degradation.</p>

<p>William was at first committed prisoner to Richmond
castle, in Yorkshire; but Henry, either
from apprehension of his being insecure among the
scarcely-extinguished embers of the late insurrection,
or wishing to enhance his value in the eyes
of the Scots, by removing him to a greater distance,
had him conveyed beyond seas, to Falaise
in Normandy. Meanwhile, the Scottish army,
thunderstruck at so unusual a calamity, after some
ineffectual and misdirected attempts at revenge,
abandoned their spoil, and hastily retreated to their
own country. Alarmed, however, at the irregularities
which the absence of the Head of their
Government was likely to produce among the discordant
and inflammable materials of which the
kingdom was composed, they too hastily agreed
to the ignominious terms proposed by the enemy;
and submitted to their King becoming the <i>liegeman
of Henry for Scotland, and all his other territories</i>;
and further,</p>

<p>“The King of Scotland, David, his brother, his
Barons, and other liegemen, agreed that the Scottish
church should yield to the English church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
such subjection, in time to come, as <i>it ought of
right, and was wont to pay</i> in the days of the
Kings of England, predecessors of Henry. Moreover,
Richard Bishop of St Andrew’s, Richard
Bishop of Dunkeld, Geoffrey Abbot of Dunfermline,
and Herbert Prior of Coldingham, agreed
that the English church should have that
right over the Scottish <i>which in justice it ought
to have</i>. They also became bound, that they themselves
would not gainsay the <i>right</i> of the English
Church.”</p>

<p>“A memorable clause!” says Lord Hailes,
“drawn up with so much skill as to leave entire
the question of the independence of the Scottish
church. Henry and his ministers could never
have overlooked such studied ambiguity of expression.
The clause, therefore, does honour to the
Scottish clergy, who, in that evil day, stood firm
to their privileges, and left the question of the independence
of the national church to be agitated,
on a more fit occasion, and in better times.”</p>

<p>“In pledge for the performance of this miserable
treaty, William agreed to deliver up to the
English, the castles of Rokesburgh, Berwick, Jedburgh,
Edinburgh and Stirling, and gave his brother
David and many of his chief barons as hostages.”</p>

<p>Thus stood the right of England to feudal homage
over Scotland in 1175. A superiority acquired
in such an ungenerous manner, was not
likely to be long submitted to with patience. The
Scots had always plumed themselves on being an
<i>unconquered</i> people, and able to preserve their independence
against all who had attempted to invade
them. <i>Vassalage</i> implies <i>protection</i>;&mdash;It
was therefore presumption in England to pretend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
to <i>defend</i> Scotland against those enemies before
whom she herself had been obliged to <i>truckle</i>.</p>

<p>It was not long before the conduct of William
displayed that covered scorn of his <i>liege-lord</i>, which
his late injuries were calculated to inspire. Countenanced
by him, the Scottish bishops, at a council
held at Northampton, boldly declared, in the
presence of the Pope’s legate, “<i>that they had never</i>
yielded subjection to the English church, nor
ought they.”</p>

<p>William also entered the lists with the Roman
Pontiff,&mdash;before whose threats and anathemas
Henry had so ignominiously crouched:&mdash;Yet
though all the thunder of the Vatican was levelled
against him,&mdash;and the Archbishop of York, armed
with Papal authority, had not only excommunicated
him, but placed the kingdom under an interdict;
still he maintained his point with inflexible
resolution, till the judgment of the apostolic
father was annulled, and an honourable compromise
obtained. The contrast thus exhibited by
his <i>vassal</i> could not be very consoling to the
feelings of the English monarch.</p>

<p>In the year 1178, William, in the same spirit,
founded and amply endowed an abbey at Aberbrothick,
in honour of the holy martyr, Thomas à
Becket,&mdash;a saint who had been thrust down the
throat of his liege-lord with the salutary application
of the whip. It would be doing William injustice
to doubt the sincerity of the gratitude which
instigated him to this act of munificence.</p>

<p>In 1189, Henry II. died, and was succeeded by
his son Richard <i>Cœur de Lion</i>. Unlike his father,
Richard, though haughty and imperious, was
alive to all the noble and virtuous qualities which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
ought to constitute the character of a king. As
soon after the obsequies of his father as decency
would permit, he invited William to his court at
Canterbury, and magnanimously restored Scotland
to her independence. The important document
runs thus&mdash;“That Richard had rendered up to
William, <i>by the grace of God, King of Scots</i>, his
castles of Rokesburgh and Berwick, to be possessed
by him and his heirs for ever as their own
proper inheritance.”</p>

<p>“Moreover, we have granted to him an acquittance
of all obligations which our father <i>extorted
from him by new instruments, in consequence of
his captivity</i>; under this condition always, that
he shall completely and fully perform to us whatever
his brother Malcolm, King of Scotland, of
right performed, or ought of right to have performed,
to our <span class="locked">predecessors.”<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></span> “Richard,” says
Lord Hailes, “also ordained the boundaries of the
two kingdoms to be re-established as they had
been at the captivity of William.” He calls them,
“the marches of the kingdom of Scotland, (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">marchiæ
regni Scotiæ</i>.”)</p>

<p>“He became bound to put William in full possession
of all his fees in the earldom of Huntingdon
or elsewhere, (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">et in omnibus aliis</i>), under the
same conditions as heretofore.”</p>

<p>“He delivered up all such of the evidences of
the homage done to Henry II. by the barons and
clergy of Scotland, as were in his possession, and
he declared, that all evidences of that homage,
whether delivered up or not, should be held as
cancelled.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
“The price which William agreed to pay for
this ample restitution, was ten thousand merks
sterling.”</p>

<p>It is with difficulty a smile can be suppressed
when we find, even in the 19th century, an author
of such learning and talents as Dr Lingard, endeavouring
to fritter away the meaning and import of
the above deed of restitution, by such fallacious
reasoning as the following: “The King’s” (Richard
I.) “<span class="smcap">Charter</span> to the King of Scots may be
seen in Rymer, i. 64. It is <span class="smcap smaller">NOT</span>, as sometimes has
been supposed, a <span class="smcap smaller">FORMAL RECOGNITION OF THE
INDEPENDENCE OF SCOTLAND</span>, but a recognition,
on the part of Richard, of all those <span class="smcap smaller">RIGHTS</span> which
Henry had extorted from William for his <span class="smcap smaller">RANSOM</span>.
In lieu of them he received ten thousand
pounds, probably the sum which William would
have given to Henry. The respective rights of
the two crowns, are now replaced on the same
footing as formerly. William was to do to Richard
whatever Malcolm ought to have done to
Richard’s predecessors, and Richard was to do to
William whatever <i>they</i> ought to have done to
Malcolm, according to an award to be given by
eight barons, to be equally chosen by the two
Kings. Moreover, William was to possess in
England the lands which Malcolm had possessed:
and to become the liegeman of Richard for all
lands for which his predecessors had been the liegemen
of the English Kings. The award was afterwards
given, by which it appears that the words
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">libertates</i>, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">dignitates</i>, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">honores</i>, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">debiti</i>, &amp;c. mean the
allowances to be made, and the honours to be shewn,
to the King of Scots, as often as he came to the
English court by the command of his lord the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
King, from the moment that he crossed the
borders till his return into his own territories,
Rym. i. 87. This will explain the clause of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Salvis
dignitatibus suis</i>, in the oath taken by the Scottish
Kings, which some writers have <span class="smcap smaller">ERRONEOUSLY
CONCEIVED TO MEAN, SAVING THE INDEPENDENCE
OF THEIR CROWN.</span>”<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> If William was
already the <i>vassal</i> of Henry, where was either the
policy or the necessity of the <i>latter</i> bringing <i>his</i>
right of homage into question, by making it again
a subject of negociation? and if it was not for “<span class="smcap smaller">A
FORMAL RECOGNITION OF THE INDEPENDENCE
OF SCOTLAND</span>” that William paid the <i>ten thousand
pounds</i> (merks) to Richard, <i>for what purpose was
that sum paid</i>? Henry extorted no money from William
for his “<span class="smcap smaller">RANSOM</span>;” his vanity being amply
gratified by the deed of homage. Richard had no
claim to 10,000<i>l.</i> from William, without granting
him what he considered an equivalent. This
equivalent could <i>not</i> have been the <i>independence
of the Scottish church</i>; for even during the reign
of Henry, we find, by a note appended by the
learned author to his work, (vol. ii. p. 397, 3d
Edit.), that when the obedience of the Scottish
church was demanded by the Archbishop of York,
“it was answered that none was due; and the answer,
after a long controversy, was confirmed by
Pope Clement III. in 1188.”</p>

<p>How “<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Salvis dignitatibus suis</i>” can be explained
so as <i>not</i> to <i>include</i> the <i>independence</i> of
the <i>monarch’s crown</i>, we are much at a loss to
perceive. One thing, however, is sufficiently apparent,
that the sophistry we have quoted ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
not to have found a place in a publication of such
acknowledged merit as that of Dr Lingard.</p>

<p>As he has evidently allowed the prejudices of
the old English chroniclers to warp his judgment
in this affair, we may be permitted, in order to
place the question on its proper basis, to quote the
following short passage from his own work, by
which it will be seen that the <span class="smcap">Lion</span> of England,
showed as little <i>pluck</i> as <span class="smcap smaller">HE</span> of Scotland, when placed
in a similar situation.&mdash;“In an assembly of the
German Princes and English envoys, by the delivery
of the cap from his head, he [Richard I.] resigned
his crown into the hands of Henry; who restored it
to him again to be held as a fief of the empire, with
the obligation of a yearly payment of five thousand
<span class="locked">pounds.”<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></span> Had this claim been prosecuted against
England with the same pertinacity as England
advanced her absurd pretensions against Scotland,
it is presumed they would have been repelled
with similar scorn and derision.</p>

<p>Though the generosity of Richard towards William
in the above transaction appears sufficiently
conspicuous, yet there was that in the situation of
his affairs which rendered it a matter of political expediency.
From the arrangements necessarily connected
with the crusade, in which he and his barons
were about to embark, it became a matter of necessity,
before he left Britain, to do something towards
smoothing down the mane of the chafed Lion of
Scotland. The gracious manner in which the
boon was conferred, fixed its proper value in the
estimation of the Scots, and “converted an impatient
vassal and implacable enemy into a faithful
and affectionate ally.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
English historians have, on this occasion, charged
Richard with impolicy. Happy would it have
been for both countries, if his successors had possessed
half the sagacity he displayed on this occasion.
The consequence of this prudent measure
was a cessation of hostilities between the two nations
for nearly a century. This tranquillity&mdash;uninterrupted
except by the assistance which Alexander
II. rendered the English barons, when engaged
in protecting their liberties against the encroachments
of King John&mdash;was highly beneficial
to both kingdoms. Intermarriages took place
among the nobility, and to such an extent, that
there were few families of note but had their connexions;
and many became possessed of lands
under both governments. Trade rose to be an
object of attention, and received encouragement
from the legislature. The Scottish burghs emerged
from obscurity; and money became so plenty,
that, though William had given ten thousand
merks for the resignation of the homage of Scotland,
and a farther sum of two <span class="locked">thousand,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span> to enable
Richard to make up the ransom exacted from
him by the Emperor, still he was able to offer fifteen
thousand merks for <span class="locked">Northumberland,<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span> besides
giving dowries upon the marriage of his two
<span class="locked">daughters,<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></span> amounting to fifteen thousand more.
The burgesses of the towns had, in this short interval,
so much increased their means, as to offer
six thousand merks on this occasion. The nobles
offered ten thousand; and on the supposition that
both ranks tendered according to their ability, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
may afford some criterion for judging of their relative
situations in pecuniary matters. Though
all these drains had been made on the treasury,
yet Alexander II. was able to give ten thousand
merks, besides lands, as a dowry to his second
sister. He also <span class="locked">sent<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></span> two bishops as envoys to
Haco, King of Norway, to negociate the purchase
of all the Western Isles, which they entreated
him to value <i>in fine silver</i>. The overture, though
declined by Haco, shows the state of the precious
metals among the Scots of those days.</p>

<p>In the year 1234, though the resignation by
Richard must have been still fresh in the memory
of the English, Pope Gregory IX., at the request
of Henry, exhorted Alexander to perform
the conditions of the old treaty between Henry
II. and William of Scotland. Alexander had too
great a regard for the Head of the Papal Church,
to let him remain long in ignorance of the impropriety
of such exhortations; and with the same
spirit which characterized the conduct of his father
towards the See of Rome, refused, according to
Lord <span class="locked">Hailes,<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></span> “to receive a Legate, whose original
commission respected England alone,” as it
“might be interpreted in a sense prejudicial to the
independency of the Scottish church. It is reported
that Alexander consented to his admission,
at the joint request of the nobility of both kingdoms,
and that he insisted for, and obtained a
written declaration from the Legate, that this should
not be drawn into a precedent. Certain it is, that
the Legate proceeded not beyond Edinburgh, and
that Alexander avoided his presence.” It is added,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
“The Legate sojourned in the principal towns
on this side the sea, and having collected a large
sum of money, secretly, and without leave asked,
he departed from Scotland.”</p>

<p>Lord Hailes continues, “Such was the magnanimity
of Alexander II. that the high-spirited
Pontiff, Gregory IX. submitted to soothe him by
a detail of specious and affected reasons, tending
to evince the propriety of a legation in Scotland.”
The “church of Scotland,” says that Pope, “acknowledges
the Romish see as her immediate
mother in things spiritual. To leave her destitute
of the consolation of a Legate from us, would be
an indignity which we cannot in conscience allow.
Were we, by our Legate, to visit the church of
England, and yet neglect the neighbouring church
of Scotland, she might think us destitute of maternal
affection.”</p>

<p>In 1239, Alexander married Mary de Couci,
daughter of a powerful baron in Picardy. The
politics of this lady’s family were adverse to England,
and Henry became jealous of her influence
over her husband. Various circumstances occurred
to foster the seeds of animosity in the mind
of the English monarch; among other things, it
was told him that Alexander had said, That
“he owed no homage to England for <i>any</i> part
of his territories, and would perform none.”
Henry secretly prepared for war, by soliciting succour
from the Earl of Flanders, and instigating
the Irish to invade Scotland; while he collected
a numerous army at Newcastle, ready to co-operate
with them.</p>

<p>Though the claim of homage was not put forth
among the reasons for this display of hostility, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
the real ground of quarrel was well enough understood
by the Scots; and on that account the
war became so popular, that though Henry had
intercepted troops sent to aid Alexander by John
de Couci, his brother-in-law, he was enabled to
confront his enemy with a formidable body of
well appointed cavalry, and nearly one hundred
thousand foot, all hearty in the cause, and animated,
by the exhortations of their clergy, to the
highest pitch of enthusiasm. Under these circumstances,
Henry found it expedient to negociate;
and his lofty pretensions were softened down to a
very moderate and reasonable agreement, viz.
“<i>Alexander became engaged to live in amity with
England, and never to aid her enemies, unless the
English should do him wrong</i>.”</p>

<p>With such a character, Henry found it was in
vain to tamper. We, therefore, hear nothing more
of Scottish homage till after the death of Alexander,
who being succeeded by his son, a child of
eight years old, Henry solicited a mandate from
Pope Innocent IV. to the effect, “That Alexander,
being his liegeman, should not be anointed or
crowned without his permission. He also requested
a grant of the tenth of the ecclesiastical
revenues of Scotland.” To expect that the last
request would have been granted, was preposterous;
but Henry perhaps imagined, that by angling
with two hooks, he might chance to catch one
fish. “The Pope honestly and peremptorily rejected
both requests; the <i>first</i>, as derogating from
the honour of a sovereign prince; the <i>second</i>, as
unexampled.” In the mean time, the Scots, without
deigning to wait the decision of the Pontiff,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
proceeded with the coronation of their infant sovereign.</p>

<p>On the 26th December 1252, Alexander III.,
being about ten years of age, appeared at York,
to celebrate his nuptials with Margaret, daughter
of Henry III., to whom he had been betrothed in
1242. After doing homage for his estates in England,
Henry also demanded that he should do
homage for the kingdom of Scotland, as a fief
holding of England, “according to the usage recorded
in many chronicles.” The answer of
Alexander showed that his instructors had not left
him unprepared on the subject. He stated, “That
he had been invited to York to marry the Princess
of England, not to treat of affairs of state, and
that he could not take a step so important, without
the knowledge and approbation of his <span class="locked">Parliament.”<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span>
Passing over the meanness of Henry,
in endeavouring to circumvent <i>a child of ten years
old</i>, the futility of thus practising upon a minor,
ought to have prevented such a proposal; since he
must have known, that although Alexander had
even then reached the years of maturity, yet, without
the sanction of his Parliament, his compliance
was unavailing. Indeed Henry’s attempt to entrap
the innocence of his son-in-law, would almost indicate
that he was very far advanced in dotage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
Henry appears either to have seen his mistake
afterwards, or to have become ashamed of his attempts
on Alexander. In 1259, the Pope, having
appointed his own chaplain, John de Cheyam, an
Englishman, to the vacant see of Glasgow, Henry
thus writes to Alexander, who intended the vacancy
for Nicolas Moffat, Archdeacon of Teviotdale.
“Although he is my subject,” said Henry,
“I would not solicit you in <i>his</i> behalf, could any
benefit arise to you from your opposition to a man
on whom the Pope has already bestowed ecclesiastical
jurisdiction.”</p>

<p>In 1260, the Queen of Scotland became <i>enceinte</i>;
and being desirous to lie-in at her father’s
court, Alexander accompanied her, after the following
clause was inserted in their safe-conduct,
“That neither the King nor his attendants should
be required to treat of state affairs during this
visit.” Henry also made oath, that he would return
the Queen and her child in safety to the
Scots.</p>

<p>In 1263, Henry affected to use his influence
with Haco, King of Norway, to desist from his
hostile intentions against Scotland. Haco denied
such intentions; and Alexander, who perhaps
questioned the sincerity of Henry’s interference,
sent the Steward of Scotland to demand payment
of the arrears of his daughter’s dowry. Henry
made a partial payment of five hundred merks,
and promised the remainder in two instalments,
one at Michaelmas 1263, and the other at Easter
1264. “I appoint such distant terms,” said he,
“because I mean to be punctual, and not to disappoint
you any more.” “To an English reader,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
says Lord Hailes, “this might seem incredible;
but the original instrument exists.”</p>

<p>In 1268, Prince Edward, son of Henry, being
about to engage in a crusade, Pope Clement IV.,
at the instigation of the English court, ordered the
Scottish clergy to pay a tenth of their revenues to
the King of England, to aid the undertaking. This
indirect attempt on their liberties was resisted by
Alexander and his ecclesiastics, who spurned at the
obnoxious assessment, though they declared their
willingness to furnish their proper quota of crusaders.
Adam Earl of Carrick, and David Earl of
Athol, with other barons, engaged in the expedition.</p>

<p>On Michaelmas day 1278, Alexander, being
present in the English Parliament, swore fealty to
Edward, in general terms, for the lands held by
him of the Crown of England. Edward accepted
it, “saving the claim of homage for the kingdom
of Scotland, whenever he or his heirs should think
proper to make it;” an early development of the
views of this ambitious monarch, which did not
escape the notice of Alexander.</p>

<p>No further measures inimical to the independence
of Scotland, appear to have been taken till
1284, when Edward applied to Pope Martin IV.
for “a grant of the tenths collected in Scotland for
the relief of the Holy Land.” The conduct of
the Pontiff, however, showed the opinion he entertained
of the request. He made the grant under
these conditions, all equally unpalateable or
inconvenient to the royal applicant: They were,
“That Edward himself should assume the cross
before Christmas,&mdash;obtain the consent of the King
of Scots&mdash;and, out of the money levied, supply
the Scottish crusaders.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
The following year, Scotland was deprived of
the prudent and watchful guardianship of her monarch;
who was killed by an accident, 16th March
1285&ndash;6. At a grand council held at Scone, 11th
April 1286, a regency was appointed for the government
of the kingdom. The lineage of Alexander
had become extinct in his person, with the
exception of an infant grandchild, daughter of Eric,
King of Norway. This female, whose right to
the crown had been solemnly acknowledged by
the Scottish barons in 1284, was deemed by Edward
a desirable match for his son; and he lost no
time in despatching ambassadors to Scotland to
negociate a marriage. From the comparatively
good understanding that had prevailed between the
two countries during the late reign, he found the
Scots no way opposed to his views. The proposal
was therefore entertained; and, on the 18th
July 1290, the regents, clergy, and baronage of
Scotland, having met the ambassadors of England
at Brigham, situated on the north bank of the
Tweed, between Coldstream and Kelso, a treaty
was concluded, consisting of fourteen articles; in
all of which not the slightest allusion is made to
any superiority over Scotland, with the exception
of the following clause:&mdash;“<i>Saving always the
right of the King of England, and of all others
which, before the date of this treaty, belonged to
him, or any of them, in the marches, or elsewhere,
or which ought to belong to him, or any of them,
in all time coming</i>.”</p>

<p>In the salvo thus artfully introduced, we have a
continuation of that quibbling, sinister, and narrow-minded
policy, which marked the conduct of the
English Government in this disgraceful affair. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
the question had been so completely set at rest,
it was extremely irritating for the Scots, whenever
any national calamity befel them, to be annoyed by
the perpetual recurrence of such barefaced attempts
upon their liberties. Though the Kings of
Scotland repeatedly did homage to the Kings of
England, for the lands they held in that country,
it was no more than what the latter submitted to
do to those of France. When the English, therefore,
strove, by such insidious measures, to entrap
the inexperience of the Scottish Kings, and to encroach
on the independence of their crown, it engendered
among those who had the honour of their
country at heart, a bitterness of spirit, which, as
the attempts were persevered in, settled down to a
deep-rooted and inextinguishable animosity. There
was no scarcity of men in both countries, who had
sufficient penetration to see, and judgment to appreciate,
the advantages that might have been secured
to <i>all</i>, were the whole island united under
one head. But, from the ungenerous policy of the
English, this desirable object could not be attained,
except by a sacrifice on the part of the Scots,
of all that honourable minds hold dear,&mdash;<span class="smcap smaller">THE GLORIES
OF A LONG AND UNCONQUERED LINE OF
ANCESTRY, THEIR OWN INDEPENDENCE, AND
THE CONSEQUENT DEGRADATION OF THEIR OFFSPRING</span>.
These were the terms which the English
unjustly demanded; and such terms the Scottish
nation as sternly <span class="locked">rejected.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span> Events have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
shown the soundness of their judgment; and their
posterity may learn, from the history of Ireland,
the extent of gratitude to which their patriotism is
entitled.</p>

<p>The question of homage has now been traced
from its origin to the negociation of Edward with
the Scots at Brigham. Had all other evidence
respecting the independence of Scotland been destroyed,
the existence of this treaty would alone
have annihilated the pretensions of Edward: For,
<i>if</i> the King of Scots had been the <i>liegeman</i> of the
English monarch, his daughter, or any unmarried
female succeeding to the throne of Scotland, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
of necessity have been a <i>ward</i> of the English
crown. Can it, therefore, for a moment be supposed,
that Edward I., a prince so feelingly alive
to what he considered his prerogative, and whose
political sagacity and intimate acquaintance with
the whole system of jurisprudence had procured
for him the title of the “<span class="smcap">English Justinian</span>,”
would have so far forgotten what was due to himself,
as to submit to <i>negociate</i>, where he had a right
to <i>command</i>?</p>

<p>The views, however, of both parties in the above
treaty, were not destined to be realized. The
young Queen, the object of such solicitude, and
on whom the hopes of the Scottish nation were
suspended, sickened on her voyage, and died
at Orkney about the end of September 1290.
No provision had been made for the succession
to the Scottish crown, beyond the offspring of
Alexander; and, as Lord Hailes judiciously remarks,
“the nation looked no farther, and perhaps
it durst not look farther.” Under these circumstances,
the sceptre of Scotland became a bone of
contention between the leaders of two powerful
factions; and there being no third party in the
country able to control and enforce the submission
of the unsuccessful claimant, it was deemed expedient
to submit their pretensions to the arbitration
of the King of England. Edward, who
watched every opportunity of aggrandizing himself
at the expense of his neighbours, had determined,
whether solicited or not, to interfere in the disposal
of the Scottish crown. Having summoned
the barons of Yorkshire, Lancashire, Westmoreland,
Cumberland, and Northumberland, (among
whom were Bruce and Baliol, the two competitors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
for the Scottish throne), to meet him, with horse
and foot, at Norham, on the 5th June, he desired
the nobility and clergy of Scotland to assemble at
the same place on the 10th May.</p>

<p>A conference accordingly was held, when Edward
commanded Roger le Brabazon, Justiciary of
England, to inform the assembly in his name,
“That he had considered the difficulties in which
the kingdom of Scotland was involved by the
death of Alexander and his offspring, and the
dangers arising from disputed succession: That
his good will and affection to the whole nation,
and to each individual in it, were sincere, <i>for in
their defence he himself was interested</i>: That he
had called the Scots to meet him at this place,
with the view that justice might be done to all the
competitors, and the internal tranquillity of the
kingdom established: That he had undertaken a
long journey to do justice, in person, to all, <i>as
Superior and Lord Paramount of the Kingdom
of Scotland</i>: That he meant not to encroach on
the rights of any man; but, on the contrary, as
Lord Paramount, to administer ample and speedy
justice to all.”</p>

<p>That his purposes might be the more effectually
accomplished, he required their hearty recognition
of his title as <i>Lord Paramount</i>; and he declared
his willingness to use their advice in the
settlement of the nation.</p>

<p>The whole assembly stood motionless and
silent. At length some one had the courage to
utter these words:&mdash;‘No answer can be made
while the throne is vacant.’ ‘By holy Edward!’
cried the King, ‘By holy Edward, whose
crown it is that I wear, I will vindicate my just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
rights, or perish in the attempt!’”<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> The Scots requested
a delay in order to inform those of their
countrymen who were absent; and, in consequence,
the proceedings were put off till the next day. A
further delay was then requested; and they were
allowed a term of three weeks. By that time,
Edward knew that the barons he had summoned
would be assembled in arms.</p>

<p>This power was, no doubt, intended to insure
the submission of the Scots. Enemies, however,
more dangerous than the English barons, were at
work in their councils. Amongst the secret emissaries
of Edward, William Frazer, Bishop of St
Andrew’s, and one of the Regents, acted with
treacherous duplicity towards his colleagues. A
partisan of Baliol, he scrupled at no means, however
disgraceful, provided they advanced the interest
of his <span class="locked">employer.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span> Conduct of this kind
could not well be concealed; it quickly engendered
animosity and distrust among those who adhered
to the interest of Bruce. Weakened, therefore,
by their jealousies, and disunited by their
conflicting interests, the aristocracy of Scotland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
soon became as subservient as the crafty usurper
could desire.</p>

<p>Edward, finding them in this manner moulded
to his purpose, and wishing to take away the appearance
of compulsion, appointed the Scots to meet
him at Upsettlington, within the boundary of their
own country. The Bishop of Bath, who was the
Chancellor of England, resumed the proceedings
of the adjourned meetings. He stated, that “by
various evidences, it sufficiently appeared that the
English Kings were Lords Paramount of Scotland,
and, from the most distant <span class="locked">ages,<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></span> had either
possessed, <i>or</i> claimed that right; that Edward had
required the Scots to produce their evidences or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
arguments to the contrary, and had declared himself
ready to admit them, if more cogent than his
own, and upon the whole matter to pronounce
righteous judgment; that as the Scots had produced
nothing, the King was resolved, as Lord
Paramount, to determine the question of <i>the succession</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>The Scots were right in refraining from the
discussion of a question which they knew had long
since been set at rest. Had they entered the arena,
they would have found themselves but ill prepared
to meet the lawyers of <span class="locked">Edward,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></span> who had possessed
themselves of the chronicles and other
writings that were kept in those Scottish monasteries,
which had been under the charge of English
ecclesiastics. These records were afterwards
found to differ essentially from those kept in monasteries
where Scottish churchmen had the superiority.
In the muniments of the former, every
thing favourable to Scotland, respecting the question,
had either been suppressed, or rendered nugatory
by interpolation; while in the archives of the
latter, her ancient independence and unsullied reputation,
were as clearly manifested. A reference,
however, to these falsified documents, surprised
and bewildered the inexperienced among the Scots.</p>

<p>It was part of the policy of Edward to increase
the difficulties of coming to a decision, by encouraging
new candidates to come forward; as their
claims, though futile, alarmed the original competitors,
and rendered them more obsequious to his
will. At this meeting eight claimants appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
for the crown, and they were afterwards increased
to ten; all of whom, including Bruce and Baliol,
acknowledged Edward as Lord Paramount of
Scotland, and agreed that seizine of the kingdom
and its fortresses should be delivered to Edward;
“because,” said they, “judgment cannot be without
execution, nor execution without possession of
the subject of the award.” Edward was to find
security for the faithful restitution of his charge
in two months from the date of his award.</p>

<p>In consequence of this agreement, Scotland and
her fortifications were surrendered into the hands
of her artful adversary on the 11th June 1291.</p>

<p>An universal homage was now required; and
during the summer, many churchmen, barons, and
even burgesses, swore fealty to the usurper.</p>

<h2 title="CHAPTER III"><a id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.<br />

<span class="subhead">BIRTH, PARENTAGE, AND EARLY YEARS OF WALLACE.</span></h2>

<p>Sir William Wallace was descended from a
respectable family in the west of Scotland. His
father, who enjoyed the honour of knighthood,
was Laird of Elderslie and Auchinbothie, and married
the daughter of Sir Raynald, or, according to
some, Sir Hugh Crawford, sheriff of Ayr. The
exact period when the ancestors of Wallace first
settled in this country, is a matter of <span class="locked">uncertainty.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
It is, however, very probable that they were originally
from Normandy; and those who support
this opinion, mention one Eimerus Galleius, as the
immediate progenitor of the Scottish family of this
name. This person appears as a witness to the
charter of the Abbey of Kelso, founded by David I.
about the year 1128, and is supposed to have
been the father of Richard Wallace, one of the
witnesses to the charter of the Abbey of Paisley,
founded in 1160, by Walter, High Steward of
Scotland. From the Steward he received a grant
of a considerable portion of the district of Kyle,
which he named Richardton or Ricardtown, after
himself. This Ricard or Richard, who was the
most powerful vassal of the Stewards in Kyle,
granted to the monks of Melrose the lands of Barmon
and Godeneth, with their pertinents; and this
grant, as appears from the <i>Chart. of Melrose, No.
127., Caledonia, III. p. 488</i>, was confirmed by
the second Walter the Steward. Richard was succeeded
by his eldest son, also named Richard, who
appears to have altered, or softened down the
name into Walays. Respecting this last person,
no particulars have been related, except that he
was cotemporary with Alan the High Steward,
who died about 1204. He was succeeded by his
younger brother Henry Walays, who acquired
some lands under the Steward in Renfrewshire,
early in the 13th century; which lands descended
by inheritance to Adam Walays, who is stated
to have been living in the year 1259, and to have
had two sons, Adam and Malcolm. Adam, being
the eldest, succeeded to the family estate of Ricardtown.
Malcolm, the father of our hero, received
the lands of Elderslie, and married, as we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
already stated, the daughter of the Sheriff of Ayr.
Some writers assert this to have been his second
marriage; and farther, that by his first he had two
daughters, one of whom was married to Thomas
Haliday or Halliday, who held lands under Bruce in
Annandale; while others maintain that he had only
two sons, <span class="locked">Malcolm<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></span> and William, the former by the
first marriage, and the latter by the daughter of
Sir Hugh Crawford. It is, however, more than
probable that these two sons were the issue of one
marriage; as Wyntown, who mentions the circumstance
of his having an elder brother, takes no
notice of their being born of different mothers.
His elder brother is, by some, supposed to have
been killed along with his father, Sir Malcolm, in
a skirmish with the English; but this statement
seems at variance with Wyntown’s <span class="locked">couplet&mdash;</span></p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">From which it would appear, that the “eldare brodyre”
outlived the father, since he succeeded to
“the herytage;” and though he may have fallen
by the hands of the English, it must have been
subsequent to the death of his father.</p>

<p>Sir William, the subject of our narrative, was
born in the reign of Alexander III. The precise
year of his birth is not mentioned in any record
at present known to exist. It is usual, however,
for our historians to commence their accounts of
him in 1297, as if he had then, for the first time,
burst forth upon the notice of his countrymen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
though they are represented as being already prepared
to place implicit confidence in his talents
as a leader, without any explanation of his previous
deeds to merit the honourable distinction.
In the preface to <i>one</i> edition of Blind Harry,
he is stated to have been about twenty-seven
years of age at the time of his execution. This,
however, would imply a precocity of stature and
strength, and a maturity of judgment too miraculous
not to be dwelt on at greater length by
those early writers who have handed down his
story. If he was twenty-seven in 1305, he would
consequently be only nineteen in 1297. Can it be
supposed that a youth of that age, without influence,
and without fame, would have been able to
persuade men, his superiors in birth, years and experience,
to array themselves under his banner, and
submit to his control? In the work of the Minstrel
we are told</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Fourty and fyve off age, Wallace was cauld,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That tym that he was to [the] Southeron sauld.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>As this, however, is at variance with what is
elsewhere stated in the same work, it is probably
an error of the transcriber, who may have mistaken
“thirtie” for “fourty,” as we find it is said, in
“Buke Fyrst,” in alluding to our hero, “Scotland
was lost quhen he was bot a child.” The term
“child” here made use of, is not to be considered
as inferring that degree of infancy usually understood
in our day, but a youth acting, or able to
act, as page or squire to some feudal superior. That
this is the Minstrel’s meaning, is evident from the
following lines,</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Yhit he was than semly, stark and bald;<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
an age inconsistent with his being 45 at the time
of his death. If we are to suppose that Henry
dated the loss of Scotland from the solemn surrender
of the kingdom, and all its fortifications, to
Edward on the 11th June 1291, it will nearly
correspond with the correction now offered; and
if his words are to be taken in the strict literal
sense, that he was thirty-five years of age on the
day he was betrayed to the English, it will follow,
that he was born on the 5th August 1270. Wyntown,
who first introduces him to notice in the
spring of 1297, says that he had already distinguished
himself in such a manner, as to have
excited the envy and animosity of the English
soldiers. In accordance with the above date,
Wallace would then be in his twenty-seventh year;
which, considering that there was no open rupture
to call forth the fiery spirits of the age till 1296,
was allowing him no more than a reasonable
time for spreading his fame among the English
garrisons stationed in Scotland.</p>

<p>1291. His early years are said to have been passed
under the superintendence of his uncle, a wealthy
ecclesiastic at Dunipace in Stirlingshire, from
whom he received the first rudiments of his education.
This worthy man had been at great pains
in storing his mind with the choicest apophthegms to
be found in the Latin classics, particularly those
where the love of liberty is most powerfully recommended;
and the efforts of the tutor were
amply rewarded by the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">amor patriæ</i> excited in the
breast of the pupil. How long he remained at
Dunipace is uncertain; but he appears to have
been at Elderslie in 1291, when the order for an
universal homage of the people of Scotland was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
promulgated by Edward, in his assumed character
of Lord Paramount. “All who came were admitted
to swear fealty. They who came and refused,
were to be arrested, until performance;
they who came not, but sent excuses, to have the
validity of their excuses tried in the next parliament;
they who neither came nor sent excuses, to
be committed to close <span class="locked">custody.”<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></span> The family of
Elderslie appear to have been among the last
class of recusants. Sir Malcolm, setting all the
penalties of non-conformity at defiance, resolutely
refused to take an oath so subversive of the independence
of his country. Aware, however, that
the strength of his fortalice at Elderslie was insufficient
to protect him against the consequences of
his refusal, he retired with his eldest son to the
fastnesses of the Lennox, while William, along with
his mother, sought the protection of a powerful
relation at Kilspindie in the Carse of Gowrie; and
from this latter place he was sent to the seminary
attached to the cathedral of Dundee, to receive
what farther education the learning of the age afforded.
Here he contracted a sincere and lasting
friendship with his biographer, John Blair, a young
man at that time of great promise, who, on finishing
his studies, became a Benedictine monk,
and afterwards officiated as chaplain to his heroic
friend.</p>

<p>With this faithful companion, and other youths
of similar dispositions, Wallace used to lament
over the degradation to which the country was
daily subjected; and, fired with indignation at the
growing insolence of the English soldiers, he formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
an association among his fellow-students for the
purpose of defending themselves, and restraining
the wanton outrages of the intruders, by chastising
their aggressions whenever the parties were to
be found in convenient situations. This, from the
licentious habits of the soldiery, frequently occurred;
and seldom were they allowed to escape, without
experiencing the effects of their vengeance.</p>

<p>In these juvenile bickerings, too unimportant to
attract the attention of those in authority, Wallace
had frequent opportunities of displaying that dexterity
and strength, with which Nature had so amply
endowed him. In him, his companions found
united all the qualifications they could desire in
a leader&mdash;a head to devise, and a hand to execute,
the most daring enterprises&mdash;a fertile imagination
ever teeming with stratagems&mdash;and a prudence and
foresight which provided against all contingencies;
so that, when once he determined on any project,
however difficult, they were always confident of
its being crowned with success.</p>

<p>It is not to be imagined that an association of
young men, among whom talents and bravery were
distinguishing characteristics, would not feel deeply
interested in the momentous crisis to which
their country was approaching. The ambition of
Edward, and his designs against the independence
of their native land, were too apparent to escape
the notice of any who had not an interest in appearing
wilfully blind. The subserviency of those
who represented the aristocracy was, therefore,
regarded by their countrymen with feelings of
humiliation and shame. It happened unfortunately
for their characters, as well as for the safety of
the country, that most of the nobility held possessions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
on both sides of the Tweed; and their
selfishness dictated a line of policy extremely dangerous
to the independence of Scotland. A wish
to preserve their estates in both countries inclined
them to a ready obedience to whatever side was
most likely to gain the preponderance. Edward,
who, in addition to his conquests on the Continent,
had annexed the principality of Wales to the English
crown, appeared to them, in the distracted
state of their country’s affairs, as very likely to
consolidate Britain under his powerful and energetic
sway. Under these feelings, they vied with
each other in their endeavours to propitiate the
usurper by disgraceful compliances. The poorer
gentry, however, entertained sentiments of a different
description, and watched the progress of the
submission respecting the succession with feverish
impatience.</p>

<p>1291. Since the surrender of the Regents on the
11th June, the different towns and castles of Scotland
had been garrisoned by English soldiers. Between
the military and the inhabitants, as might
have been expected, brawls were of no unfrequent
occurrence&mdash;and in those which came under the notice
of our hero, he seldom remained an inactive
spectator. Gilbert de <span class="locked">Umfraville<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></span> being removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
from the command of the castles of Dundee
and Forfar, one Selby, the head of a freebooting
family in Cumberland, was appointed to succeed
him. His son, a fiery and impetuous youth,
having too rashly insulted Wallace, the latter
struck him dead on the spot with his dagger;
and, though surrounded by the train of his insulter,
effected his escape to the house of a female
dependent, who concealed him from his pursuers.
Besides young Selby, two or three others, who attempted
to intercept him in his flight, were either
killed or severely wounded. The case, therefore,
became one of too serious a nature to be overlooked.
The prudent management of his preserver
enabled him to quit the town without being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
observed. An act of outlawry followed this slaughter;
and Wallace was hunted from covert to covert
by the emissaries of the constable, who, eager
to revenge the death of his son, offered great rewards
for his apprehension. His success in eluding
his pursuers was equal to the boldness of his
<span class="locked">offence.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
After lurking among the woods and impenetrable
recesses of the country, till the heat of the
pursuit had subsided, Wallace ventured to communicate
with his relations at Kilspindie. The
anxiety of his mother respecting his fate required
to be relieved; and, in obedience to her solicitation,
to remove himself further from the scene of danger,
he agreed to accompany her on a pilgrimage
to the shrine of St Margaret at Dumfries. The
dress required for this purpose afforded a suitable
disguise; and the respect paid by the English to a
saint of the royal blood of their country, insured,
in those days of superstition, all the facilities which
their situation required.</p>

<p>While our hero was thus employed, his father,
it would appear, had become obnoxious to the
English; but in what manner, we are left entirely
to conjecture. Whether they had endeavoured to
apprehend him, for disobedience to the order already
alluded to, or if, driven from his house and
his resources, he found himself constrained to retaliate
upon his oppressors the injuries they had
inflicted, are circumstances respecting which all
authorities are silent.</p>

<p>An unfortunate rencounter, however, appears
to have taken place in the district of Kyle in Ayrshire,
between Sir Malcolm, at the head of a few
of his retainers, and a party of the English, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
an officer of the name of Fenwick; in which, after a
gallant resistance, the Scots were defeated and
their chieftain slain. Blind Harry asserts, that the
brother of Wallace also fell on this occasion; but
he is evidently mistaken, as it has already been
shown from Wyntown, that Sir Malcolm was succeeded
in his estate by his eldest son.</p>

<p>The death of his father was not calculated to
lessen the animosity which Wallace had hitherto
entertained towards the English. Thirsting for
revenge, he spurned the offers of some of his relations,
who proposed to use their influence to get
the act of outlawry recalled; and having placed
his mother under the charge of his uncle Sir Raynald
Crawford, he again betook himself to the
woods.</p>

<p>The talents, strength, and dexterity of the young
outlaw, soon attracted to his fortunes a number of
reckless and intrepid spirits, inclined alike from
habit and from circumstances, to prefer a life of
savage and unrestrained liberty, to the uncertain
and degrading protection of those, who, though
wearing the mask of friendship, were daily wounding
their feelings, by their encroachments on the
independence of their country.</p>

<p>1292. As Scotland, at that time, abounded with
game of every description, Wallace and his companions
found no difficulty in maintaining themselves
in their woodland retreats; from whence also they
could issue forth to surprise the English, and supply
themselves with those necessaries which their situation
otherwise prevented them from obtaining.
However well disposed the regency and barons of
Scotland might have been to submit to the claims
of England, it was quite different with the nation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
and the proceedings of Wallace, though not sanctioned
by the shadow of government which still lingered
in the country, were viewed by the poorer classes
of the Scots, not only with indulgence, but with
approbation. From the prevalence of this feeling,
he derived many important advantages, and much
useful information respecting the movements of his
enemies.</p>

<p>At this early period of his history, his conduct
is said to have drawn upon him the notice of
Thomas of Ercildoune, otherwise named Thomas
the Rymer. This <i>shrewd</i> observer of the “signs
of the times,” so highly appreciated his talents and
hardihood, as to risk his prophetic fame, then in
its zenith, by pointing him out to his countrymen
as the man destined to restore the ancient glory of
Scotland. His matchless strength and acute wit,
joined to the sagacity with which he gave effect
to his stratagems, tended, no doubt, to impress the
seer with this favourable opinion. Among the
stories told of his early years, the following are
perhaps entitled to a preference, on account of
their being, as Lord Hailes observes, “characteristical.”</p>

<p>One day, having visited Ayr in disguise, his
attention was attracted by a crowd collected near
the quarters of the military. In the midst of a
circle of his own countrymen, there stood an Englishman
of huge dimensions, playing off his raillery
against the Scots, and offering, for a groat,
an opportunity of avenging any injury they might
have received from the English, by permitting the
best among them to exert their utmost strength in
striking a blow upon his back with a pole which
he held in his hand; accompanying this absurd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
declaration with certain ridiculous gestures and
scurrilous language, while his mailed companions,
with arms akimbo, stood loitering around, laughing,
and enjoying the humour of their bulky buffoon.
Wallace approached, and tendered treble
the sum for the permission offered. This was
readily agreed to by the jester, who winked to his
companions as he prepared to fulfil the conditions.
The wary Scot had observed the trick; and, grasping
the pole above the place where it was intended
to give way, he let fall a blow with such good will,
that the spine yielded to its force, and the foolish
witling sunk with a groan at the feet of his companions.
Instantly the swords of the English
were out to revenge the slaughter of their favourite.
One of them, advancing towards the offender,
received a blow on the head, which laid him
lifeless across the body of the jester. Surrounded
on all sides by the increasing numbers of his adversaries,
he plied his weapon with a rapidity and
a force which kept the most forward of them at
bay. Over the steel bacinet of a powerful trooper,
the fatal pole was shivered to pieces. Others,
seeing him, as they imagined, disarmed by this accident,
rushed forward, expecting to overwhelm
him with their numbers; but on drawing his
sword, which he had concealed under his dress,
they as quickly receded from the well-known
power of his arm. Having, by his trusty blade,
cleared the way to one of the outlets of the town,
he was there attacked by two of the boldest of
the garrison, who had not before mingled in the
fray. The object of one of them appeared to be, to
engage him in a little sword-play, and thus give his
party an opportunity of hemming him in, but Wallace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
aware of the value of his time, broke through
the guard of his artful opponent, with a blow
which clove him to the teeth; while the other, in
the act of retreating, received a thrust through an
opening in his armour, which, reaching his vitals,
laid him senseless by the side of his companion.
Five of the English soldiers had now fallen beneath
the arm of the youthful warrior; and the
rest seemed so averse to come within his reach,
that he had time to gain a little copse in the
neighbourhood, where he had left his horse before
he entered the town, and, bounding into the saddle,
the hardy trooper was soon beyond the reach
of any fresh assistance they might procure. Horse
and foot were, however, soon on the alert; but
after a long and a fruitless pursuit, they were obliged
to return,&mdash;some of those who had already
witnessed his prowess no way displeased at their
want of success.</p>

<p>The entire absence of any thing like fear, seems
to have formed the most prominent feature in the
character of Wallace. Although he had so narrowly
escaped on the above occasion, and also
aware of the ease with which he could be recognised,
yet it was not long before he ventured back
to the same place. The occasion was as follows:</p>

<p>A report had circulated about the country, that
on a day named, a celebrated English prize-fighter
would exhibit on the esplanade at Ayr, as a general
challenger. An occurrence of this kind had
powerful attractions, in an age when every man
required to know something of the use of a sword.
Scots, as well as English, became deeply interested
as the day of exhibition drew on; and Wallace,
instigated partly by curiosity, and partly by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
a wish to acquire information respecting the numbers
and the motions of his enemies, determined
to be present. Having equipped himself and fifteen
of his companions with dresses which concealed
their habergeons, he proceeded to the scene
of action. Their horses they left in a place of
safety outside the town, and then made their entry
from different directions, in such numbers as
would not attract the notice of their enemies.</p>

<p>In the midst of the crowd collected to witness
the feats of the English champion, Wallace stood,
with his face partially concealed in his cloak, to all
appearance an unconcerned spectator, till he saw
several of his countrymen, who had been baffled
by the superior dexterity of their more practised
antagonist, afterwards scoffed at, and otherwise insulted
by the English soldiery. The feelings which
this conduct excited were displayed on the fine expressive
countenance of our hero, in such a manner
as did not escape the notice of the victor; and
the latter, flushed with his success, invited him to
a trial of his skill. Wallace readily accepted the
challenge; and, drawing his sword, prepared for
the onset. The ease and grace with which he
handled his weapon soon convinced the English
that their “bukler-player” had at last engaged in
a perilous enterprise. His art and agility appeared
unavailing against the cool self-possession of the
Scot, who, after a few passes, became the assailant;
and a blow, which descended with the rapidity
of lightning, laid the arrogant gladiator dead
at his feet. This unexpected interruption of their
amusement irritated the English; but when they
discovered, in the successful combatant, the bold
and audacious outlaw with whom they had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
so lately engaged, they eagerly crowded round,
and endeavoured to prevent his escape. Unappalled
by the numbers with whom he was environed,
he dealt his blows in all directions with unerring
and deadly effect, while his followers, drawing their
swords, attacked those who were nearest them with
a fury that spread consternation and uproar through
the whole assemblage.</p>

<p>The English, finding themselves assailed from
so many quarters, conceived that they were surrounded
by a multitude of enemies. Wallace, always
first in the place of danger, according to the
homely, but expressive phraseology of Blind Harry,
“<i>Gret rowme” about him “maid</i>;” and the enemy
had already begun to give way, when an additional
force from the castle made its appearance.
The battle was now renewed with redoubled fury
on both sides; and the capture of our hero being
the principal object in view, he became the subject
of their most inveterate hostility. The few,
however, who ventured within his reach, soon paid
the forfeit of their temerity. Having collected his
companions in a body, he fearlessly advanced into
the centre of the English, diminishing their numbers
with every stroke of his broadsword, while
his followers pressed with determined ferocity upon
those who attempted to intercept him. From
the increasing number of his opponents, he at last
became apprehensive of having his retreat cut off,
if the unequal contest were much longer protracted.
Placing himself, therefore, in front of the battle
he ordered them to make the best of their way,
while he endeavoured to prevent the enemy from
harassing their rear. By incredible exertions, they
at last regained their post at the outside of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
town; and, mounting their horses, they were soon
lost to their pursuers amid the shades of Laglane
woods, leaving about thirty of the English, among
whom were three knights belonging to Northumberland,
dead upon the streets of Ayr.</p>

<p>These, and similar exploits, appear to have furnished
employment to Wallace, during the time
that the English held possession of the country
under the nominal authority of the Scottish regency.
It will now, however, be necessary to revert
to the proceedings on the Border.</p>

<h2 title="CHAPTER IV"><a id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<span class="subhead">ACCESSION OF BALIOL&mdash;SIEGE OF BERWICK&mdash;BATTLE OF DUNBAR.</span></h2>

<p>1292. The submission respecting the succession to
the crown of Scotland was now drawing near a close.
There is reason to believe, that the knowledge of
many of the humiliating circumstances, which had
occurred during its progress, had been confined, in
a great measure, to the parties engaged in it. Enough,
however, had transpired to excite the jealousy
of the poorer gentry, who, having no possessions
out of Scotland, considered their honour
as inseparably connected with its independence.
When the edict, therefore, was proclaimed for a
general homage to the King of England, the national
degradation became apparent, and the servility
of their more powerful representatives was
regarded with undissembled mortification. The
dangerous practice of allowing the influential barons
to hold lands in England, might now be regretted;
but the fatal effects were, for the present,
beyond the power of remedy. Eager for the removal
of the English garrisons, and desirous for
the establishment of something like a regular government,
the body of the Scottish nation, concealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
their chagrin at the conduct of Edward, became
anxious for the decision. The machinations
of Frazer, and the influence of the Bishop of Durham,
at last determined the English King to declare
in favour of John Baliol, who received the
crown with all humility, and swore fealty to the
royal arbiter, as his liege-lord, at Norham, on the
20th November 1292. On the 30th of the same
month, he was crowned at Scone; and, on the
26th December following, he again repeated his
oath of allegiance at Newcastle.</p>

<p>1293. John, though he had not made a greater sacrifice
of the national dignity than the other candidates
were prepared to agree to, soon found, on
his return to Scotland, that the station he had
been so desirous to attain, was surrounded by
cares and difficulties of no ordinary description.
The conduct of Edward, too, in continually harassing
Baliol with summonses to attend complaints
instituted against him in the English courts, on
very trifling occasions, was a source of unceasing
annoyance; and while the latter reflected on the indignities
he had already submitted to, he was conscious
of having forfeited every claim to the sympathy
or respect of his people, by the sacrifice he had
made of their independence. It seemed evident, indeed,
that the only chance which remained of recovering
their favour, was to renounce the fealty he had
sworn, and to afford them an opportunity of effacing,
by force of arms, the stigma that had been
affixed to their national character.</p>

<p>That this was the feeling of the Scots, is manifest
from the alacrity with which they came forward,
when Baliol, stung almost to madness by
the repeated insults received from his liege-lord,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
had determined to throw off his allegiance. Levies
of Scottish troops had been ordered by Edward
to be made and sent to him, in order to be employed
in an expedition which he meditated against
France. This, the newly crowned vassal had
neither the inclination nor the ability to perform;
on the contrary, he secretly negociated an alliance
with the French King.</p>

<p>1294. The Scots assembled in parliament at
Scone; and, “under the specious pretence of diminishing
the public charge, they prevailed on Baliol to
dismiss all the Englishmen whom he maintained at
his court.” “They then appointed a committee of
twelve&mdash;four bishops, four earls, and four barons&mdash;by
whose advice all national affairs were to be regulated.
If we may credit the English historians,
they had a watchful eye over Baliol himself, and
detained him in an honourable <span class="locked">captivity.”<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></span> This
latter circumstance, more than any other, evinces
the feelings of the people on the occasion.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to say how Wallace was
employed at this particular period. It seems probable,
that, relieved by the removal of the English
from the apprehensions he might have entertained
of the consequences of the act of outlawry, he became
permanently resident among his relations. In
a charter of <i>James, Lord High Steward of Scotland</i>,
dated in 1294, confirming the donation of
the predecessors of Sir Arthur de <span class="locked">Denoon<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></span> to the
monastery of Paisley, the witnesses are, <i>Robert,
Bishop of Glasgow</i>, <i>John, the brother of the Lord
High Steward</i>, Sir Arthur de Denoon, <i>Sir Nicolas
Campbell</i>, <i>and Sir Reginald Crawford</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
Knights; William de Shaw, Alexander de Normanville,
Esquires. Though Wallace is not mentioned
here, yet we have the names of five of his
future companions in arms; and it may be doubted
if Sir Nicolas Campbell, whose patrimony lay
at such a distance, would have made a journey to
Paisley for the mere purpose of witnessing a charter
in which he had no personal interest, had objects
of greater moment not attracted him to the
spot;&mdash;and possibly, a wish to visit Wallace at Elderslie,
of whom, as has been already stated, he
was a school-companion and intimate associate,
may in a more satisfactory manner account for his
appearance on that occasion, while the presence
of Sir Reginald Crawford, the uncle of Wallace,
rather increases the probability of this conjecture.
The association of the names of so many parties
with whom he was afterwards so closely connected,
is at all events a very singular circumstance.
The fame he had acquired by the exploits already
narrated, and the dangers he had escaped, would
no doubt have excited the curiosity and the sympathy
of his friends.</p>

<p>1295. The treaty which Baliol negociated with
France was peculiarly offensive to Edward. After
stating that the King of Scotland, “grievously affected
at the undutiful behaviour of Edward to the King
of France his liege-lord,” he bound himself to assist
King Philip with all his power, and at his own
charge, in the event of Edward invading France.
Philip also agreed to aid the Scots, if attacked by
England, either by making a diversion in their
favour, or by sending succours. In this treaty
were included the prelates, earls, barons, and other
nobles of Scotland, as well as the Universities and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
distinguished public bodies of that kingdom, who
were thereto required to affix their <span class="locked">seals.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></span> Indeed
it may be considered as truly a national treaty,
shewing the degree of <i>surveillance</i> which the
Scots exercised over the conduct of Baliol.</p>

<p>1296. The treaty was soon followed by a solemn
renunciation of the homage exacted by Edward;
and a numerous army was collected for the invasion
of his northern counties. The Scots,
though thus eager to come to blows, were by
no means in a state of discipline that would enable
them successfully to contend with the experienced
veterans of England, who had been inured
to martial habits in their wars with France,
and possessed many advantages over troops that
had never seen the face of a foreign enemy.
Thirty-three years had elapsed since the battle of
Largs; and the residue of those warriors who
had distinguished themselves on that occasion,
could not now be either very numerous or effective.
The country, it is true, teemed with men
in the vigour of life, panting to restore the tarnished
glory of their country; but although individually
brave, and not unacquainted with their
weapons, yet, unaccustomed to act in concert,
they could neither fully understand their own deficiency,
nor sufficiently appreciate the advantages
of that discipline which gave the enemy so great
a superiority. Under these circumstances, and
guided more by the hasty dictates of their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
passion than the commands of their leaders, the
army of the Scots burst into Cumberland, on 26th
March 1296. The injury done, however, was
not very extensive. They assaulted Newcastle,
and set fire to the town, but were eventually compelled
to a dishonourable retreat.</p>

<p>On the 8th April they also entered Northumberland,
plundered Lanercoste and Hexham, and retired
in disorder from before Harbottle.</p>

<p>At this time, a circumstance of rather a curious
nature took place. An English nobleman, Sir
Robert de Ros, lord of the Castle of Werk, had
become deeply enamoured of a Scottish lady, and,
influenced by the violence of his passion, he deserted
the standard of his country, and went over
to the Scots. With the intention of gaining the
affections of the object of his desire, he endeavoured
to seduce his kinsman, William de Ros,
from his allegiance. In this, however, he was unsuccessful;
for William, after upbraiding him with
his baseness, proceeded to the camp at Berwick
to inform Edward of the treason, who furnished
him with 1000 men, to garrison the Castle of
Werk. Robert, in the mean time, had joined the
Scots; and learning that the troops sent by Edward
were to quarter the following night at Prestfen,
on their way, he procured a body of Scots
from Roxburgh, and secretly surrounded the village.
To enable his followers to recognise each
other, he gave them, as a password, “<i>Tabard
and Surcoat</i>;”<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> commanding, that whoever named
the first of these words, if the person to whom he
expressed it did not reply by giving the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
he should instantly kill him. With this understanding
they entered Prestfen at midnight, and,
setting fire to the houses, surprised and cut off
the enemy.</p>

<p>Edward, who had now reached Berwick with
an army equal in numbers to that of the Scots,
and more formidable from its superior discipline,
determined to attack the town both by sea and
land. His navy was, however, found unequal to
the task, and eighteen of his ships were either
burnt or disabled. The <span class="locked">exasperation<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></span> which this
discomfiture occasioned in the mind of Edward,
increased, if possible, the natural ferocity of his
temper, and determined him to lead in person his
army to the <span class="locked">assault.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
The first attack of the English was repulsed.
On the second, a well-concerted stratagem put
them in possession of the town, which was given
over to pillage, and a frightful and unsparing massacre
ensued. Some English writers state, that no
less than forty thousand of the <span class="locked">inhabitants<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></span> were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
immolated, to assuage the wrath of the victor.
Wyntown, however, may be considered nearer the
truth, when he fixes the amount of the carnage
at seven thousand five hundred. Barons and burgesses,
nuns and friars, women and children,&mdash;<i>all</i>
were involved in one indiscriminate and appalling
butchery, which continued through the day, and
only subsided when the following occurrence rekindled
the spark of humanity, which had become
extinct in the breast of the unprincipled usurper.</p>

<p>This catastrophe, from which Berwick never
entirely recovered, took place on <i>Good Friday</i>,
while the people were preparing for the celebration
of that high festival&mdash;a circumstance which sufficiently
proves that the Scots were taken by surprise.
Edward remained at Berwick from the
30th of March till the 27th April, during which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
time he received the formal renunciation of the
allegiance of Baliol, who also published an edict,
ordering all English ecclesiastics holding benefices
in Scotland to quit the country.</p>

<p>On the 27th April, regardless of the atrocities
resulting from his guilty ambition, Edward left
the shambles at Berwick, and proceeded northward
on his desolating career, having previously
despatched the Earl of Warren, with ten thousand
chosen troops, to reduce the Castle of Dunbar.
This fortress, from its strong position, was considered
as one of the keys to the kingdom, and
had belonged to the Earl of March, a disappointed
candidate for the crown, who had now attached
himself to the banner of England. His wife,
however, possessing more patriotism than her husband,
delivered it over, in his absence, to be garrisoned
by the King of Scotland. Aware of its
importance, Baliol led the army he had collected,
amounting to upwards of 40,000 men, to its defence.
In the meantime, Sir Richard Siward, the
governor, had agreed to deliver it up to Warren
in three days, if not relieved. On the third day,
the army of Scotland appeared on the heights,
and took up a strong position on Downhill, above
Dunbar. Warren advanced to attack them; and
from having a difficult line of road to traverse, his
ranks became irregular. The Scots, from their
elevated station, saw the momentary confusion,
and foolishly imagined that the English were on
the retreat. Under this impression, they abandoned
their strong and well-chosen position, and
rushed down on the enemy. The English received
their disorderly charge with firmness, and
repulsed them with slaughter. Broken, and dismayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
at their unexpected reception, a great part
of the Scots betook themselves to flight. Sir Patrick
Graham, however, and a few chivalrous spirits,
maintained the unequal contest; and, though
mostly cut to pieces, yet the heroism and self-devotion
they displayed, extorted the applause,
and excited the regret, of their adversaries.</p>

<p>Though there be no direct evidence of the fact,
yet there is reason to conjecture, that both Wallace
and his brother were present at the battle of
Dunbar. It has already been shown, from respectable
authority, that Sir Malcolm outlived his
father; and, in the work of the Minstrel, we have
an account, though rather obscure, of the manner
in which he met his death. He is represented
as surrounded by a multitude of enemies, and
bravely defending himself on his knees, with all
the energy of despair, after he had been hamstrung,
in order to prevent his escape. Being at
last borne down by a mass of spearmen, he was
unmercifully put to <span class="locked">death.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></span> Though Henry does
not mention when this took place, yet, from the
previous comparative tranquillity which reigned in
the country, the conflict of Dunbar appears most
likely to have been the scene of so deadly a struggle;
and the close intimacy which Wallace afterwards
maintained with the family of Graham, may have
originated in the circumstance of his brother and
himself having been among the few who stood by
their chief, Sir <span class="locked">Patrick,<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></span> on this disastrous occasion.</p>

<p>The banner of Sir Richard Siward (<i>black, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
a white cross flowered at the ends</i>)<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> still floated on
the battlements of the Castle of Dunbar. To this
place many of the Scottish barons fled for refuge.
The protection they received, however, was of
short duration. The fortress, according to agreement,
was surrendered to Warren. On this Lord
Hailes remarks, “Our historians impute this also
to treachery; and they accuse the Governor,
Richard Siward. But this charge is manifestly
unjust. Siward had agreed to surrender the castle,
if it was not relieved within three days; and
it was not relieved.” His Lordship is sometimes
rash in bringing charges against the historians of his
country. The treason of Siward did not consist
in delivering the castle, according to agreement,
but in <i>making that agreement</i>. There is enough
in the fact of his consenting to surrender one of
the strongest and most commanding fortresses in
the country, in so short a time, to warrant the
charge they have made against him. That the
Scots nobles were ignorant of the terms, is evident
from their flying to it, after the battle, as to
a place of safety, which they would not have done,
had they known that they were instantly to be
delivered over in chains to the mercy of the enemy.
Siward could have no certainty of his being
succoured in three days, as the Scottish army, according
to his Lordship’s account, only came in
sight “on the <i>third</i> day;” and if any accident had
detained it, Dunbar must have been surrendered on
the day following. Besides, if Lord Hailes had
referred to Vol. II. p. 274, 275, of the Chronicle of
Peter Langtoft, an Englishman, and a favourite
authority of his own, he would have found not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
only the statement of Scottish authors confirmed,
but a regular detailed account of the treason.
That his Lordship, in the face of such evidence,
should have charged the Scottish historians with
doing what was “<i>manifestly unjust</i>,” can only be
imputed to that singular predilection towards white-washing
the Negro, which his Lordship has displayed
on so many occasions.</p>

<p>1296. Ten thousand Scots were slain at this memorable
battle, and a vast number were made prisoners,
among whom were many of the principal nobility
of the kingdom, who were sent to the South
in chains, and distributed among the prisons of
England and Wales. Baliol, after performing a
most degrading feudal penance, and imploring the
clemency of his conqueror, was sent prisoner, along
with his son Edward, to the Tower of London,
having previously resigned the kingdom and
the people of Scotland into the hands of Edward.
Thus terminated the brief and unfortunate reign
of John Baliol, who had aspired to a sceptre he
had neither the judgment nor the energy to wield.
With a spirit subdued before the commanding genius
of Edward, any efforts he made to regain the
independence he had relinquished, were rather
forced upon him, by the impatience of his people
to the English yoke, than the result of any magnanimous
resolution of his own. Though possessing
qualities that might have graced the seclusion
of private life, he was destitute of those talents
which were required in the discharge of the duties
of a sovereign.</p>

<p>Selected by Edward from the other competitors,
more on account of the natural timidity of his
character than the superior justice of his claim,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
it is impossible to look on the degradation that
was inflicted on him, without feeling disgusted at
the total want of generosity which marked the
character of the English monarch. Listening to
the <i>interested</i> advice of the Bishop of <span class="locked">Durham,<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></span>
who counselled him to set aside the claim of
Bruce, because the talents and spirit of the latter
might be troublesome, he arrayed Baliol in the
trappings of royalty; and, while he insulted the
tame unresisting puppet he had created, he fancied
himself trampling with impunity on the hitherto
unsullied majesty of a free people.</p>

<p>The destruction of Berwick, and the discomfiture
at Dunbar, laid Scotland prostrate at the feet
of her invader, who marched triumphantly through
the kingdom, receiving the homage of the terrified
chieftains, and placing garrisons in the deserted
fortresses; while churchmen of all grades, Earls,
Barons, Knights and Esquires, hastened to avert
his displeasure, by taking the oath of allegiance,
and renouncing the French alliance.</p>

<p>On the 6th <span class="locked">June,<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></span> Edward besieged and took
the Castle of Edinburgh, in which he found the
regalia, consisting of the crown, sceptre, and
cloth of gold. On the 14th, he was at Stirling
and Linlithgow. On the 24th July, he encamped
on the banks of the Spey. He was at Elgin on
the 26th, where he remained two days. He was
at Aberbrothick on the 5th August, and again at
Stirling on the 14th, at Edinburgh on the 17th,
and at Berwick on the 22d, having spent twenty-one
weeks in his progress of <span class="locked">subjugation.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></span> For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
the final settlement of his conquest, he appointed
John, Earl of Warren, Lieutenant or Guardian of
the kingdom; Hugh de Cressingham, an avaricious
ecclesiastic, treasurer; William Ormsby,
justiciary; Henry de Percy, keeper of the county
of Galloway and sheriffdom of Ayr; while Robert
de Clifford had charge of the eastern districts.
The ancient Great Seal of Scotland, surrendered
by Baliol at Brechin, was broken in pieces, and a
new seal in place of it, was presented to Walter
de Agmondesham, as chancellor.</p>

<p>The conduct of these ministers was ill calculated
to secure the conquest which the policy and
talents of their master had achieved. Haughty
and rapacious themselves, they imposed little restraint
on the licentious soldiery, who lorded it
over the wretched inhabitants with the most intolerable
brutality. While property of every description
was held by the frail tenure of the will
of the usurpers, outrages were committed on the
domestic feelings of the oppressed, which the delicacy
of modern writers have withdrawn from the
page of history. Neither was this galling oppression
confined to the common people; the cup of
misery went round; and the noblest of the land
partook of its unmingled bitterness. The unlimited
exactions of Cressingham, and the little controul
he exercised over his underlings, soon banished
commerce from the Scottish shores. Deprived,
by his impolitic proceedings, of this lucrative
branch of the national resources, with whetted
appetite for plunder, he turned upon the
wretched and already impoverished inhabitants,
who looked in vain to their nobles for that protection
afforded them in times past. Those chieftains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
who would have stepped forward in their
defence, had either fallen beneath the axe of the
executioner, or were languishing out the prime of
their existence in the distant dungeons of the invader.</p>

<p>The fiendish policy that instigated the massacre
of the Minstrels of Wales, lest their strains should
animate their countrymen to revolt, had also suggested
the idea of depriving the Scots of the <span class="locked">monuments<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></span>
of their ancient glory. The nobility
still remained tame spectators of this fresh outrage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
and relaxed not in their supple assiduities to conciliate
the favour of the tyrant. Thus abandoned
by those who ought to have been her protectors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
the distracted country, crushed and bleeding at
every pore, lay convulsed within the <i>coils</i> of this
human <i>Boa</i>. But that Providence which “ruleth
in the kingdoms of men,” had foreseen her calamity,
and prepared a deliverer, with personal qualifications
beyond the common lot of men, and a
mind endowed with every requisite for the mighty
undertaking.</p>

AND BRUCE.</span></h2>

<p>Wallace, who had been stigmatized by the English
as an outlaw and a robber, found it necessary,
after the battle of Dunbar, to withdraw to his former
mountainous retreat, from whence he would,
no doubt, observe the gaudy pageant of the feudal
power of England, as it traversed the devoted land
in all the insolent security of conquest. And
while the national distress deepened around, and
every tale that reached him was fraught with tidings
of the misery of his enslaved and degraded
countrymen, the resources of the enemy, and the
possibility of emancipating the beloved land of his
nativity, formed the subject of his unceasing reflections.
He had observed, that the reverses which
the Scots had sustained in the field, arose more
from a want of subordination and discipline among
themselves, than from any superior valour on the
part of their enemies. He was aware of, and
deeply lamented, the jealousy and treachery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
which existed among the nobility, and their readiness
to stoop in the most servile <span class="locked">manner<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></span> to
the will of the Usurper, if they might thereby
obtain even a temporary exaltation for their
party; and he justly conceived, that by banding
together a few resolute spirits, allied to no
faction, but, like himself, attached to the general
good, that more could be done toward the
restoration of his country’s independence, than by
all the tumultuous hordes which the treacherous and
disunited chieftains could bring together. Fully
impressed with this conviction, his days and nights
were passed in extending the number of his followers,
and in organizing a system of warfare,
which was soon destined to spread terror and dismay
among the invaders. The <i>elite</i> of every district
were instructed and disciplined in a manner
peculiarly his own. With the simple, but well-known
sounds of his bugle-horn, he could regulate
all their operations. At the appearance of danger,
he could disperse them, to seek more secure
retreats,&mdash;or rally them around him, as circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
might require. This mode of discipline,
either by himself or his most trusty associates, he
secretly extended over a great part of the Lowlands
of Scotland; so that either amidst the fastnesses
of Carrick, the deep recesses of Cartland,
or on the shores of the Lomond, the rallying note
of their country’s liberator was followed by the
prompt appearance of well-armed warriors at their
respective places of muster.</p>

<p>The prowess which he had displayed in his encounters
with the English&mdash;his almost miraculous
escapes&mdash;and the prediction given out in the
name of the Seer of <span class="locked">Ercildowne,<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></span> of his being
destined to deliver Scotland from the tyranny of
England,&mdash;all conspired to excite the hopes, and
gain him the confidence, of the less wealthy classes
of his countrymen.</p>

<p>His tactics were admirably fitted for harassing
the foes he had to contend with. The fortresses
in their possession were surrounded by secret enemies,
ever on the watch to discover and convey to
their leader any information that might enable him
to way-lay their convoys, or surprise them in
their strongholds. It was in vain the warders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
kept watch on their lofty stations: distant as the
eye could reach, no enemy appeared, no foreboding
sound met their ear, to warrant them in
disturbing the tranquillity of the revellers within.
Far in the woodlands, the sound of a horn might
be heard; but it passed away unregarded, as proceeding
from some lonely forester going his rounds.
The drawbridge is let down to admit fuel or provisions
for the garrison;&mdash;the loads are thrown in,
the entrance of the gate;&mdash;the porter knocked on
the head, and the burden-bearers bristle into resolute
or well-armed assailants;&mdash;the wine-cup is
dashed from the hands of the astonished governor,
who is only made sensible of his situation by the
carnage that ensues;&mdash;the castle demolished, and
the spoil divided among his followers, who are now
allowed to return home. Wallace, meanwhile, attended
perhaps by a few select worthies, pursues his
way, to call forth the avenging swords of his adherents,
in some more remote part of the kingdom.</p>

<p>Such were the fruits of that admirable system
of warfare which Wallace was engaged in explaining
and enforcing at the meetings of his nonjuring
countrymen, during the winter of 1296, and
which it has been thought proper to allude to at
this stage of the history, in order that the reader
may be able to comprehend the possibility of certain
of those exploits which afterwards obtained
for the heroic champion of the Scots, the applause
and admiration of mankind.</p>

<p>The spring of 1297 had scarcely set in before the
<i>guerrilla</i>-parties thus formed began to molest the
invaders; and so persevering and successful were
their attacks, that in a very short time, throughout
the whole range of the forest of Clydesdale, Wallace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
and his followers held undisputed sway; and,
emerging from parts least expected by the enemy,
surprised and cut off their convoys. The English
garrison which occupied Bothwell Castle made
several attempts to drive them from their concealments
in the woods, but all their efforts had ended
in discomfiture and disgrace; while the prisoners
left in the hands of the Scots were hung up at
different parts, along the skirts of the forest, as
a warning to all hostile intruders. These proceedings
of the insurgents alarmed and perplexed
the English, as it kept them in profound ignorance
of the numbers they had to cope with.
Left to their own conjectures, their heated imaginations
peopled the impenetrable recesses of the
woods with swarms of fierce and merciless enemies,
headed by a chief against whose sword the
strongest of their armour afforded but a feeble
protection.</p>

<p>While the Scots were thus engaged, their leader
received advice that a strong convoy was on its
way from England for the supply of the garrison
of Ayr, under the command of Fenwick, the person
who headed the attack so fatal to Sir Malcolm
Wallace. Roused by the hopes of avenging the
death of his father, our hero determined to way-lay
the party. For this purpose he selected fifty
of those on whose strength and courage he could
place the greatest reliance; and thus attended, he
set forward to occupy a position on the road the
enemy had to pass. It was night when the little
band of patriots reached the spot from whence they
meant to make their attack; but hearing nothing
of the advance of Fenwick, he ordered his men to
take shelter for the night in a neighbouring wood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
The morning was pretty far advanced, when
two scouts, whom Wallace had sent forward at
day-break, returned with the intelligence that the
enemy was at hand. Having arranged his men
for the onset, his friend, John Blair, offered up
prayers for their success, which were scarcely over
before the English came in sight. Fenwick, on
observing the small body of Scots that awaited
his approach, felt perfectly assured of taking them,
and the far-famed chieftain, whom he suspected
to be their leader, prisoners with him to Ayr; and
congratulated himself on the satisfaction which the
capture of the bold outlaw would afford to his superiors.
This pleasing reverie was, however, disturbed
by a rapid movement of the Scots, who,
charging with their long spears, threw his advance
into confusion, and, following up their advantage
with the most daring intrepidity, carried disorder
to the very centre of his squadron; where, undismayed
by the superior numbers that surrounded
them, Wallace and his brave companions fought
with all the fury of exasperated lions. The repeated
charges of the English were repulsed and
returned with such increasing vigour and resolution
as alarmed and confounded their commander.
Wherever he turned his eyes, the sword of the
Scottish chief seemed clearing a path toward him;
helmet after helmet disappeared beneath his ponderous
weapon; and the whole exertion of his
mighty arm seemed directed towards the hated
Fenwick. Conscious of the justice of that vengeance
which inspired our hero with more than
usual ferocity, the English chief would gladly have
avoided a personal rencounter. His attempts to
escape, however, were in vain,&mdash;the brand of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
vengeful Scot reached him at last; and the blow,
though broke by the intervening sword of a trooper,
fell with sufficient force to strike him from the
saddle. Falling on the opposite side of the horse,
Wallace had not the satisfaction of giving the deathblow;&mdash;this
was an honour reserved for Robert
Boyd, one of his most intimate companions. Although
Fenwick was thus slain, yet the conflict
continued with great obstinacy. The English, under
one Bowmond, who was second in command,
made great efforts to retrieve the advantages they
had lost. The Scots, however, maintained their
ground with inflexible resolution, while the sword
of their chief was rapidly increasing the gaps in
the ranks of their enemies. Adam Wallace, the
promising heir of <span class="locked">Riccardtoun,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></span> had the good fortune
to come in contact with the leader of the
English; and, after an obstinate engagement, the
intrepid Bowmond fell beneath the hand of the
youthful Scot. Deprived of their leaders, the
English now fled in the utmost confusion, leaving
one hundred of their companions on the field.
The Scots pursued them only so far as to make
their victory certain; and, returning to the spoil,
found their labours amply rewarded. A numerous
train of waggons, loaded with flour, wine, and all
sorts of provisions, with warlike stores in abundance,
and two hundred draught-horses, besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
money and other valuables, fell into the hands of
the victors, who, after dividing their booty, and
appropriating part of it to the relief of the oppressed
inhabitants in the neighbourhood, departed to
secure the remainder in their inaccessible retreats
among the then extensive forests of Clydesdale.</p>

<p>The result of this affair with Fenwick was not
less encouraging to the Scots, than prejudicial to
the English. The valuable convoy, which the latter
had been thus deprived of, was a subject of
serious regret to Percy; more particularly, as it
appeared irretrievable&mdash;his foraging parties having
already exhausted the district under his controul,
and reduced the inhabitants to the most wretched
expedients, in order to maintain their miserable
existence. The fields remained in a great measure
uncultivated; and those among the commons who
were fortunate enough to possess a cow, endeavoured
to conceal her as their only resource. The
poor starveling was bled as often as nature would
permit; and the blood, boiled to a consistency,
formed almost the sole repast of the unhappy owners.
Percy, already aware of the impoverished
situation of the country, had husbanded the resources
of the garrison, in order to make them
hold out till the arrival of the expected supplies.
Under these circumstances, his disappointment may
be easily conceived, when the disordered remains
of Fenwick’s party arrived at Ayr without a leader,
to give an account of their disaster, every man
being at liberty to tell his own story; and, as might
be expected, all of them agreed in exaggerating
the number of the Scots, and the gigantic stature
and strength of their chief. Percy, even from the
most favourable view of the affair, could only see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
the embarrassing situation in which he was placed.
The uncertainty of procuring supplies by land was
but too evident; and to bring them by sea was
equally precarious, as the Scottish ships were still
numerous on the coast, and had not acknowledged
the sovereignty of Edward, but in the unsettled
state of the country, continued to capture all the
English vessels that came in their tract.</p>

<p>In this battle, which was fought at a place called
<span class="locked">Beg,<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></span> above Allanton, in the parish of Galston,
few of any note among the Scots were slain. Of
those present on the occasion, the following names
have been handed down&mdash;Sir Andrew Murray,
Sir William Douglas, Robert Boyd, Alexander
Scrimgeor, Roger Kilpatrick, Alexander Auchinleck,
Walter Newbigging, Stephen of Ireland,
Hugh Dundas, John Kneland or Cleland, Ruthven,
Sir David Barclay, Adam Curry, John Blair
and Thomas Gray. In justice, therefore, to these
brave and early confederates of our hero, we
shall appropriate the remaining part of this chapter,
to such notices of them as our scanty materials
may afford. The following account of the first
of those worthies is taken from the Peerage and
Baronage of Scotland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
<i>Sir Andrew de Moravia, dominus de Bothwell</i>,
succeeded his brother Sir William Murray,
in the Lordship of Bothwell. This Sir William
was chamberlain to Alexander III., and a man
of singular merit; but dying without issue in
1294, he was succeeded by his no less meritorious
brother, who also filled the office of
chamberlain under the short reign of Baliol.
Sir Andrew married a daughter of Sir John Cumin,
Lord of Badenoch, by whom he had two
sons, Sir Andrew and Sir William, the former of
whom was associated in the command of the Scottish
army when led by Wallace to the invasion
of England. He also was chamberlain to Bruce,
and regent of the kingdom in the minority of David
II. He married Lady Christian Bruce, sister
of the immortal King Robert, by whom he had
two sons, John and Robert. His brother William
was the progenitor of the Murrays of Abercairnie.
The present “Sir Andrew sat in parliament in
1290, and appears to have sworn fealty to Edward
1291. When Sir William Wallace raised
the standard of national independence, and when
the other powerful barons deserted the cause, he
was the only person of consequence who adhered
to Wallace.”</p>

<p><i>Sir William Douglas</i>, designated the Hardy,
succeeded his brother Hugh. He was also known
by the name of <i>Long Leg</i>, and reckoned to be a
very handsome and powerful man, surpassing most
of his countrymen in stature. He appears to have
been present in the Parliament at Brigham in
1289, as his name is appended to the letter addressed
by “the community of Scotland,” to Edward
I., as “<i>Guillame de Duglas</i>.” He swore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
fealty to Edward in the Chapel of Thurston, 5th
July 1291. His first wife was Elizabeth, a near
connection of the Steward of Scotland, who died
shortly after her marriage. His second was Eleanor,
the widow of William de Ferrier. She being
a ward of the English crown, had an assignation of
the manors of Stubbings and Woodham Ferriers
in Essex (part of her husband’s lands), until she
should have her dowry set forth; which, being soon
after assigned to her, she came to Scotland, there
to obtain her right to such lands as her husband
had possessed in that kingdom. But being at
Tranent, (the manor-house of Helen la Zusche),
expecting the like assignation, Sir William de
Duglas came and forcibly carried her <span class="locked">off.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></span> As
the lady had made oath before she left England,
not to marry without the royal consent;&mdash;to save
appearances, and to preserve her property, a complaint
was made of the aggression, and Edward
sent his precept to the sheriff of Northumberland,
to seize all the goods and chattels of the said William
de Duglas which were in his bailiwick; but
shortly after, in 1291, in consequence of a fine of
10<i>l.</i> to the King, his permission was obtained.
In 1296, Sir William had the command of the
Castle of Berwick, which he surrendered to the
English, being allowed to march out with the honours
of war, after taking an oath never to bear
arms against England. Such oaths, however, in
that age it was reckoned more dishonourable to
keep than to break. The following account of some
of his exploits is from Hume of Godscroft’s History
of the House of Douglas:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
“When he” (Sir William) “heard that William
Wallace was risen up, and had taken open banner
against the English, he joined with him; by which
accession of forces, Wallace’s army was much increased
and strengthened. Yet they were not always
together; but, according to the occasion, and
as opportunity did offer, they did divide their companies,
and went to several places, where they
hoped to get best advantage of the enemy, and
where there needed no great army, but some few
companies at once. In these adventures, Lord
William recovered from the English the castles of
Desdier and Sanquhair.</p>

<p>“The manner of his taking the castle of Sanquhair
is said to have been thus:&mdash;There was one
Anderson that served the castle, and furnished
them with wood and fuel, and had daily access to
it upon that occasion. The Lord Douglas directs
one of his trustiest and stoutest servants to deal
with him, or to find some means to betray the
castle to him, and to bring him within the gates
only.</p>

<p>“Anderson, either persuaded by entreaty, or
corrupted with money, gave my Lord’s servant,
called Thomas Dickson, his apparel and carriages,
who, coming to the castle, was let in by the porter
for Anderson. Dickson stabbed the porter,
and gave the signal to his Lord, who lay near by
with his companions, set open the gates, and received
them into the court. They, being entered,
killed the captain and the whole of the English
garrison, and so remained masters of the place.
The captain’s name was Beauford, a kinsman of
his own Lady Ferrars, who had oppressed the
country that lay near him very insolently. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
of the English that had been in the castle, escaping,
went to the other garrisons that were in other
castles and towns adjacent, and told them what
had befallen his fellows, and withal informed them
how the castle might be recovered. Whereupon,
joining their forces together, they came and besieged
it. Lord Douglas, finding himself straitened,
and unprovided of necessaries for his defence,
did secretly convey his man Dickson out at a
postern, or some hidden passage, and sent him to
William Wallace for aid. Wallace was then in
Lennox, and, hearing of the danger Douglas was
in, made all haste he could to come to his relief.
The English, having notice of Wallace’s approach,
left the siege, and retired towards England; yet
not so quickly but that Wallace, accompanied by
Sir John Graham, did overtake them, and killed
five hundred of their number before they could
pass Dalswinton. By these, and such like means,
Wallace, with his assistants, having beaten the
English from most part of their strengths in Scotland,
did commit the care and custody of the whole
country, from Drumlanrig to Ayr, to the charge
of the Lord Douglas. Now, however, there be
no mention of these things in our chronology; yet,
seeing the Book of Wallace (which is more particular
in many things) speaks of them, and the
charter of the house of Symington, descended
lineally of the said Thomas Dickson, who, for
this and his other like services done to the Lord,
and afterward to his good son Sir James, got the
twenty merk land of Hesle-side, which his posterity
doth still enjoy, holding of the Lords of Douglas
and Angus; and there is no doubt to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
made, but he hath done much more in his assistance
he gave Wallace, than is recorded or extant
any where; there being no likelihood that, in these
so busy times, these two valiant and brave warriors
did lie idle, although the particulars lie buried in deep
silence.” The above account is fully confirmed by
the manuscript history of the House of Douglas,
written by Thomas Chambers, who adds, that “Sir
William, before the battle of Falkirk, was betrayed
into the hands of the English, and conveyed to
Berwick, and from thence to York, where he was
keeped close prisoner in the castle until his death,
which took place in 1302, and was buried in a
little chapel (now decayed) at the south end of
the bridge.” The banner of Douglas was “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">azure
a chiffe sylvir</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></p>

<p><i>Sir Robert Boyd</i>, or <i>Boyt</i>.&mdash;This bold and
hardy warrior was also one of those who swore
fealty to Edward I., when he overran Scotland
in 1296; but throwing off his disgraceful allegiance
in 1297, he became ever after the inseparable
companion of Wallace. His father,
in consequence of the gallantry he displayed at
the battle of Largs, obtained a grant of lands
in Cunningham from Alexander III., and was
the near neighbour of Sir Raynald Crawford of
<span class="locked">Crosby,<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></span> the uncle of Wallace; the castles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
the two families could communicate by signals with
each other.</p>

<p><i>Kneland</i>, or <i>Cleland</i>, <i>Edward Little</i> and <i>Thomas
Haliday</i>, all near relatives of Wallace, whose names
are frequently mentioned with applause by the
authors who write of this period.</p>

<p><i>Stephen of Ireland.</i>&mdash;This brave and useful soldier,
is sometimes called Stephen Ireland; but
this is only by modern writers. Blind Harry, and
other ancient authors, invariably designate him as
<i>of Ireland</i>. It is highly probable that he was one
of those self-expatriated Irish noblemen, whose
love of liberty induced them to seek, in foreign
countries, what they could no longer hope for at
home. Whatever his birth may have been, he appears
to have come to Scotland at an early period,
perhaps in the reign of Alexander III., and seems,
from his being occasionally employed as a guide in
the expeditions of Wallace, to have had such a
knowledge of the country, as could only be acquired
by a long residence in it. Through all the
variety of fortunes which attended Sir William
Wallace, and amid the desertions of some of his
opulent countrymen, Stephen of Ireland adhered
to him with inflexible fidelity, and also induced
others of his countrymen to come over to the assistance
of the Scots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
<i>John Blair</i> and <i>Thomas Gray</i>.&mdash;The former
of these worthy ecclesiastics has already been
mentioned as the schoolfellow of our hero. After
quitting Dundee, he went to finish his studies at
Paris, where, under the most eminent masters of
the day, his progress did not belie the early promise
of his genius; and he returned to Scotland a
confirmed patriot, and an accomplished scholar.
The latter had the pastoral charge of Libertown,
yet considered it no dereliction from his duties to
attend and assist in the emancipation of his country.
Of his literary talents we have reason to form
the highest opinion, from the circumstance of John
Blair admitting him into the honour of assisting in
composing the history of their far-famed friend. This
work, though it now goes all under the name of
Blair, was then known to have been the joint
composition of these worthies. Where Thomas
Gray received his education, is a matter of uncertainty;
but it is highly probable that he also finished
his studies along with his friend at Paris,
and returned with him to Scotland; as we hear
nothing of him previous to the rencounter with
Fenwick. It is not unlikely that, on this occasion,
John Blair was installed in his office of chaplain;
and that he got this preference from the circumstance
of the other being already provided for, as
they both appear, from their learning and patriotism,
to have been equally deserving of the affection
and confidence of their countrymen.</p>

<p><i>Alexander Scrimgeor.</i>&mdash;This faithful patriot was
the representative of an ancient and respectable
family in the neighbourhood of Dundee; and as
he most probably received his education along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
with Wallace, he would no doubt have been one
of the association already alluded to. He enjoyed,
in right of his ancestors, the honour of carrying
the banner of Scotland; and for his faithful
discharge of this duty, he was afterwards appointed
by Wallace to the office of <span class="locked">Constable<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></span> of Dundee;
which honour being hereditary, remained in
the family till after the restoration of Charles II.,
when the representative of the family was created
Earl of Dundee; on whose death, without immediate
issue, the heirs were unjustly deprived of
their honours and immunities. The family, however,
continues to be represented by the Scrymgeours
of Birkhill, now the Wedderburns of that
Ilk.&mdash;<i>Stat. Acc.</i> vol. viii. p. 239.</p>

<p><i>Walter Newbigging</i>, otherwise <i>Gualter de Somerville</i>.&mdash;This
gentleman was of English extraction,
and the son of William de Somerville, Baron
of Linton, and Margaret Newbigging, heiress of
that Ilk, the daughter of Walter Newbigging, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
lands he inherited in right of his mother. This
accounts for his being called Walter Newbigging,
or of Newbigging. His father, William de Somerville,
distinguished himself at the battle of
Largs, and was a constant attendant at the court
of Alexander III., with whom he was in high favour,
and held the office of grand falconer, a
place at that time of considerable importance.
Walter, the subject of our present inquiries, received
from his father a <i>ten merk land</i> within the
barony of Linton, which enabled him to make an
early appearance at court, where his good qualities
and noble deportment attracted the notice of
Alexander, from whose hand he received the honour
of knighthood, and distinguished himself at
the tournament held shortly after in honour of the
marriage of Prince Alexander with the daughter
of the Earl of Flanders, at Roxburgh Castle.
While in attendance at court, he formed an acquaintance
with Sir David Barclay of Towie, in
Aberdeenshire, whose sister Effie, or Euphemia,
he afterwards married in 1281; and at Aberdeen,
the same year, he entered into a bond of manrent,
or manred, as it was sometimes called, with his
brother-in-law. These obligations were very common
among the gentry of Scotland, and often productive
of great disorder in the country. By this
marriage he had a son named David, whom he devoted
to the cause of his country’s independence,
when he himself joined the standard of Wallace.
This youth we shall afterwards have occasion to
notice. It may not be improper to remark, that
Somerville, the author of “The Chase,” was a
scion from the English stock of this ancient and
respectable family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
<i>David de Barclay.</i>&mdash;Abercromby mentions a
Sir Fergus Barclay, as being one of the early adherents
of Wallace; but there is reason to believe
he is partly in error. Sir David Barclay, as we
have already seen, was brother-in-law to Sir Walter
Newbigging, with whom he had entered into a
bond of manrent, by which they were mutually
bound to appear in arms in support of the same
cause, provided it was not against the royal prerogative.
When we find both the surnames associated
together on this occasion, we may reasonably
suppose they are the same persons who contracted
the obligation, and had thought the present
a very proper opportunity for acting upon <span class="locked">it.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>Hugh de Dundas</i> was the son of Serle de
Dundas, who swore fealty to Edward I. in 1296
and in 1300. His son, Sir Hugh, was a man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
singular merit and fortitude, and joined the brave
Sir William Wallace in defence of the liberties of
Scotland, and embraced every opportunity to exert
his courage against the enemies of his country.
He died in the reign of King Robert Bruce, and
was succeeded by his son.”&mdash;<i>Douglas’s Scottish

<p>After the foregoing brief notices of the early
companions of Wallace, the curious reader may
not be displeased, if, before concluding this chapter,
we present some account of the dress and armour
in which our hero appeared at the battle of
Beg. The following description is from the Minstrel,
and is given with a minuteness which induces
a belief that it is a literal translation from the work
of Blair, so often mentioned;&mdash;it is at least of value,
not only from its containing the ideas entertained on
the subject by a man of no mean genius, upwards
of three hundred years ago, but as it also agrees
with the description elsewhere handed down of
the kind of armour in use at the <span class="locked">period:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“A habergione vndyr his goune he war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A steylle capleyne in his bonet but mar;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His glowis of plait in claith war couerit weill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his doublet a closs coler of steyle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His face he kepit, for it was euir bar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his twa handis, the quhilk full worthi war.”<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="attrib"><i>Buke Thryd</i>, p. 31.
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The “<i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">habergione</i>” was a piece of defensive armour
early in use among the Scots, and even worn
by some Highlanders and Isles-men so late as the
17th century. It was a sort of chain or ringed
mail, extremely light and flexible, allowing the
greatest freedom to the motions of the wearer, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
was equally well adapted for combat on foot or
on horseback. It was variously constructed according
to the prevailing taste. The most approved
were those brought from Asia by the crusaders,
in the early part of the reign of Alexander III.
They consisted of four rings joined to a fifth, and
all rivetted;&mdash;they were sometimes double. Towards
the end of the 13th century, this description
seems to have been in general use, both in
England and Scotland. They had the form of
shirts, and were quite impervious to an arrow.</p>

<p>The “<i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">goune</i>” which the Minstrel alludes to, as
covering the “habergione,” we conceive to mean
the surcoat, or coat of arms,&mdash;a fashion introduced
into Britain in the 13th century. It is thus described
by Dr Meyrick:&mdash;“The surcoat, which
had been adopted by the crusaders in the 13th
century, to prevent their armour from being heated
by the sun’s rays, a mode still continued by the
Mamelukes in Egypt, was at first of merely variegated
patterns, but soon became embellished
with the same armorial bearings as the shield;&mdash;hence,
the expression ‘coat of arms.’ It was a
long loose dress, without sleeves, open before and
behind, for the convenience of riding, and girted
round the waist by the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">cingulum militare</i>, or belt.
It was put on over the hauberk, and reached to
the neck; and when the hood was placed on the
head, it was covered by it as far as the shoulders.
The front and back were emblazoned alike.”</p>

<p>This piece of dress appears to have been the
same as the tabard. It is thus taken notice of by
Thomas Hearne: “<i>Tabard</i>, a jacket, jerkin, mandilion,
or sleeveless coat, worne in times past by
noblemen in the warrs; but now only by heralds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
and is called their coat-of-arms in service.” Verstegan
tells us, in his <i>Restitution of Decayed Intelligence</i>,
“That <i>tabert</i> was anciently a short
gown, that reached no further than the mid-leg,
that it remaineth for the name of a gown in Germanie
and in the Netherlands, and that in England,
it is now the name only of <i>a herald’s coat</i>.”
But what Stowe tells us, in his <i>Survey of London</i>,
is more remarkable, where, talking of several
fair inns in Southwark, he takes occasion to
speak of the Tabard Inn as the most ancient of
them, and thereupon writes thus: “Amongst the
which innes, the most ancient is the Tabard, so
called of the signe, which, as wee now term it, is
of a jacket, or sleevelesse coate, whole before, open
on both sides, with a square collar, winged at the
shoulders: a stately garment, of old time commonly
worne of noblemen and others, both at home
and abroad in the wars; but then (to-wit, in the
warres) their armes embroidered, or otherwise depict
upon them, that every man by his coate of
armes might bee knowne from others: But now
these tabards are onely worne by the heralds, and
bee called their coates-of-armes in service.” Allusion
is also made, by Wyntown, to the tabard of
John Baliol, who, on being stript of the ensigns
of royalty by his <i>magnanimous</i> conqueror, the
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pelure</i>” or fur, was also torn from his tabard.
The passage is <span class="locked">curious:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“This Jhon the Balliol on purpos<br /></span>

<div class="attrib"><i>Wyntown</i>, vol. ii. p. 88.
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">steylle capleyne</i>,” it is very likely, may
have been taken from the “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chapelle de fer</i>,” or
“iron hat,” which, the same writer says, had a rim
and convex crown, and was worn over the capuchon
or hood. “After being placed on the head,
it was kept from turning round, when struck, by
cords, with which it was fastened to the shoulders.
The effigy of Sir Roger de Trompington not only
gives its form, but shows that it was sometimes
held to the body by means of a chain. It was ornamented
in front with a cross fleury, the transverse
bar of which was pierced with occularia, or
openings for the sight.” That worn by Wallace,
however, does not appear to have had this advantage,
for</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“<i>His face he kepit, for it was euir bar,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>With his twa handis.</i>”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>The limbs were usually defended at this time,
by being encased in boiled leather, on which knee-plates
of iron, and guards for the shin-bones, were
fixed; these, with a round or triangular shield,
painted with the armorial bearings of the wearer,
formed the defensive armour of the period.</p>

<p>Wallace’s favourite weapon appears to have been
a long and ponderous two-handed sword, which
his prodigious strength enabled him to wield with
the greatest <span class="locked">ease.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></span> The mace and spear were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
also at times used by him; and for close rencounters
in castles, peels, and other confined situations,
he was furnished with a dagger for each
hand, of a particular kind, having guards, which
extended above the wrist, between which the hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
passed; and grasping a transverse bar about an
inch from the spring of the dagger, the weapon
projected from the centre of the first, like the
horn of an unicorn. This sort of dagger was often
attached, by a kind of hinge, to the arm-plate,
and could be folded back under the arm between
the wrist and the elbow when not in use, and secured
and concealed in that position by the cloth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
gloves, which our hero appears to have worn over
his “glowis of <span class="locked">plate.”<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></span></p>

<p>Having said thus much of the dress and equipment
of Wallace, the following anecdote respecting
his strength and personal appearance, may not
be unacceptable to the reader; it is translated
from Hector Boëce by the learned editor of Morrison’s
edition of Blind Harry, who thus introduces
it. “Though this author (Boëce) in general is
not much to be credited, yet it would be hard not
to believe him in an instance which happened near
his own time, and in which, if he had spoken falsely,
he could immediately have been detected. The
anecdote in another respect is curious, as it affords
an example of longevity, not unsimilar to that of
the Irish Countess of Desmond, who attained a
still more advanced age.</p>

<p>“The date is the year 1430. At that time,
James I. was in Perth; and perhaps having heard
<i>Henry the Minstrel</i><a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> recite some of Wallace’s exploits,
found his curiosity excited to visit a noble
lady of great age, who was able to inform him of
many ancient matters. She lived in the castle of
Kinnoul, on the opposite side of the river, and
was probably a widow of one of the Lords of
Erskine, a branch of whose family continued to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
be denominated from the barony of Kinnoul, till
about the year 1440. It was Boëce’s manner
to relate an event as circumstancially as if he had
been one of the parties, and engaged in it; I shall
therefore give the anecdote in his own manner,
by translating his words:</p>

<p>“‘In consequence of her extreme old age, she
had lost her sight, but all her other senses were
entire; and her body was yet firm and lively; she
had seen William Wallace and Robert Bruce,
and frequently told particulars concerning them.
The King, who entertained a love and veneration
of greatness, resolved to visit the old lady,
that he might hear her describe the manners
and strength of the two heroes, who were admired
in his time, as they now are in our’s. He therefore
sent a message, acquainting her that he was to
come to her next day. She received the message
gratefully, and gave immediate orders to her
handmaids to prepare every thing for his reception
in the best manner, particularly that they should
display her pieces of tapestry, some of which were
uncommonly rich and beautiful. All her servants
became busily employed, for their work was
in some degree unusual, as she had not for a long
time been accustomed to receive princely visitors.
The next day, when told the King was approaching,
she went down into the hall of her
castle, dressed with as much elegance and finery
as her old age and the fashion of the time would
permit; attended by a train of matrons, many of
whom were her own descendants, of which number
some appeared more altered and disfigured by
age than she herself was. One of her matrons
having informed her that the king was entering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
hall, she arose from her seat, and advanced to meet
him so easily and gracefully, that he doubted of
her being wholly blind. At his desire she embraced
and kissed him. Her attendant assured
him that she was wholly blind; but that, from
long custom, she had acquired these easy movements.
He took her by the hand and sat down,
desiring her to sit on the same seat next to him.
And then, in a long conference, he interrogated
her respecting ancient matters. He was much
delighted with her conversation. Among other
things, he asked her to tell him what sort of
a man William Wallace was? what was his personal
figure? what his courage? and with what
degree of strength he was endowed? He put
the same questions to her concerning Bruce.
Robert, she said, was a man beautiful, and of a
fine appearance. His strength was so great, that
he could easily have overcome any mortal man of
his time:&mdash;But in so far as he excelled other men,
he was excelled by Wallace, both in stature and in
bodily strength; for, in wrestling, Wallace could
have overcome two such men as Robert was.</p>

<p>“‘The King made some inquiries concerning his
own immediate parents, and his other ancestors;
and having heard her relate many things, returned
to Perth, well pleased with the visit he had made.’”

enthusiasm, became impatient to prosecute hostilities
against their oppressors; and their leader, who
was not of a character to allow the swords of
brave men to rust in their scabbards, soon found
them an opportunity to gratify their wishes.</p>

<p>At Gargunnock, in the neighbourhood of Stirling,
the English had erected a small fortification
or <i>peel</i>, which they had plentifully furnished with
provisions. Some of the Scots in that quarter,
who secretly adhered to Wallace, observed the
carelessness which at times prevailed in setting
the watch, and that the drawbridge was occasionally
left down all night, for the purpose of admitting,
in the morning, the labourers who were
still employed about it,&mdash;conveyed the intelligence
to their chief, who resolved to make himself master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
of the place the following night. Accordingly,
two spies were despatched to ascertain the
probability of success. Towards evening a column
of smoke was seen rising from a neighbouring hill:
it was the signal agreed upon, if the party were to
advance. Wallace instantly set his men in motion,
and about midnight arrived in front of the place
which was the object of attack. As they expected,
the drawbridge was down, but they found the door
strongly secured within. Impatient at the delay
this occasioned, our hero raised a heavy piece of
timber, and, rushing with it against the door, the
fastenings gave way with a violence that loosened
the stones, not yet properly cemented, and nearly
a yard of the wall came tumbling to the ground.
The porter, awakened by the noise, attempted to
strike him with a ponderous mace. Wallace avoided
the blow; and, before he could recover his unwieldy
weapon, laid him lifeless at his feet. Thornton,
the captain of the garrison, now appeared,
with the men under his command; but the Scots
had got too firm footing within the fort, to be
easily expelled. After a sanguinary conflict, in
which the captain fell by the hand of Wallace, the
garrison were put to the sword, with the exception
of the women and children, who received
from the victors as much courtesy as the rudeness
of the age entitled them to expect. The wife
and three children of Thornton, after being supplied
with what necessaries they required, were allowed
to depart along with the other females, and
furnished with a pass from Wallace, by which they
could proceed in safety to any of the towns in the
possession of the English. The Scots found in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
peel of <span class="locked">Gargunnock<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></span> abundance of all kinds of
necessaries, with a large sum of money, which
Wallace divided equally among his followers; and,
after distributing what part of the stores they did
not require among his oppressed countrymen in
the neighbourhood, he demolished the fortification,
and proceeded with his companions on their crusade
against the enemies of their independence.</p>

<p>Though Wallace was thus actively engaged in
harassing the enemies of the country, the calamities
and acts of oppression with which particular
families or individuals were visited, neither escaped
his attention, nor failed to call forth that
interference which their circumstances demanded;
and, amid the many cases of private suffering which
came under his notice, none appeared to affect him
more deeply than the desolation which had overtaken
a respectable and ancient family in the neighbourhood
of Lanark. Hew de Bradfute, a zealous
advocate for the liberties of Scotland, possessed
the lands of Lamington, and left them at his
death to his son, who had imbibed, with all the ardour
of youth, that love of liberty so fondly cherished
by his father. For some display of these patriotic
feelings, he had incurred the displeasure of Hasilrig,
or Hasliope, the English governor of Lanark, who
found a pretext for attacking him in his castle, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
put him, along with a number of his friends, to the
sword. The house and lands of Lamington now
became the right of a surviving sister. The youth
and beauty of this young gentlewoman attracted
the notice of the murderer of her friends; and,
under the pretence of a regard for her safety, obliged
her to take up her residence in Lanark. For
this <i>protection</i>, considerable sums were, from time
to time, levied upon her property. The cupidity
of Hasilrig, not satisfied with these exactions, intended
her as a match either for himself or his son;
and the helpless girl had no means of averting this
hateful connection, but by pleading for delay, till
her grief for her slaughtered kindred had abated.
Every indulgence of this kind was accompanied by
a fresh exaction on her property, till the victim of
his avarice became an object of commiseration even
to those who were themselves suffering under the
hand of the oppressor. Henry draws a most fascinating
picture of this lovely orphan; and we have
no reason to doubt the assemblage of virtues and
graces in which he has arrayed her person and character,
particularly as he is borne out in what he
says by the Prior of St Serf’s, and other respectable
authorities.</p>

<p>While attending her religious duties at a church
near Lanark, Wallace first saw this interesting female.
The beauty of her person, the grace and
propriety of her demeanour, added to her forlorn
situation, excited the tenderest sensations in the
bosom of our hero. A circumstance, however, which
occurred about this juncture, served to divide his
attention with the fair object of his solicitude.</p>

<p>For the purpose of levying fresh assessments on
certain districts of the country, an extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
council of the English authorities was appointed
to meet with the Bishop of Durham, at Glasgow,
which see had been now occupied by this ambitious
ecclesiastic. Sir Raynald Crawford, the uncle
of our hero, though long since deprived of his commission,
was summoned to attend as sheriff of Ayr
in right of his birth. Whether this was an indirect
attempt to conciliate Wallace, or if it was
merely done on the supposition that the Scots
would submit to their imposts with more patience
if some of their countrymen appeared as the assessors,
cannot now be distinctly ascertained. The
sheriff, however, prepared to obey the mandate;
while his nephew, always suspicious of the intentions
of the English, resolved, along with two of
his followers, to watch over the safety of his relative,
and observe the motions of the enemy. In
those times the accommodations for travellers were
far from complete. With the exception of convents,
such houses of entertainment as might be
found on the roads, afforded them little more than
shelter from the inclemency of the weather; and travellers
who came to spend the night, were expected
to bring their food and other necessaries along with
them, particularly those who journeyed with retinues.
Under such circumstances, Sir Raynald’s
party were provided with a sumpter-horse to carry
their provisions.</p>

<p>They had not proceeded far, before they came
up with the servants of Percy, conducting his baggage.
One of their horses having met with an accident,
they stopped the sheriff’s party, and insisted
on having their sumpter-horse, in order to supply
the place of the one that had become disabled. It
was in vain to remonstrate with those who had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
power, and were determined to do an act of injustice.
Wallace, from a distance, saw the load
rudely thrown from the back of the horse, and
the animal carried off. The sheriff, in consequence,
had to remain at Mearns for the night.</p>

<p>The convoy that protected the baggage of Percy
consisted of five of his personal retainers, and had
reached the vicinity of the little township of Cathcart,
when they heard the noise of our hero’s
steed behind them, followed by his companions;
but as there appeared to be only three to five,
the English determined to stand on their defence.
The contest, however, was soon decided; and
the English, from the loopholes of the neighbouring
castle of Cathcart, saw their countrymen
slaughtered, and the baggage under their protection
rifled or carried off, without venturing to quit their
stronghold. Money and other valuables, to a considerable
amount, fell into the hands of the victors,
who lost no time in making their way towards
Glasgow, in order to cross the Clyde at that place,
and thus effect their retreat into the Lennox before
Percy could be apprised of his loss.</p>

<p>Having effected their object, they sheltered
themselves for the night in the neighbourhood of
Dumbarton, and on the morrow proceeded towards
the wilds of the Lomond. Here Wallace was joyfully
received by Malcolm Earl of Lennox, who,
with a number of his trusty tenantry, maintained,
amid the fastnesses of that romantic district, a protracted,
and sometimes a successful struggle, for
their independence. This nobleman offered to
place his followers under the command of Sir
William, provided he would remain among them
for the defence of the Lennox. His mind, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
was too deeply impressed with a desire for
the general good of his country, to allow him to
think of confining his exertions within the limits
proposed. On explaining his plan of warfare to
this worthy chieftain, he found no difficulty in
gaining him over to his views, and inducing him
to co-operate in extending the spirit of insurrection,
as well as to create a more powerful diversion
in favour of those who were already embarked in
the cause. With this understanding, Wallace took
his departure, accompanied by a number of his
companions, who had resorted to him on discovering
the place of his retreat.</p>

<p>The mortification of Percy, on receiving the accounts
of the capture of his baggage, was considerably
increased by the subsequent proceedings of
Wallace and his partisans. An express had just
reached Glasgow, announcing the fate of the garrison
of Gargunnock, when another made his appearance,
giving an account of the slaughter of a
party of English in the neighbourhood of Doune.
Sir Raynald Crawford, who had been put under
an arrest on suspicion of being concerned in the
affair at Cathcart, was now ordered before the
council, and, though he had been able to establish
an <i>alibi</i> with regard to the offence charged against
him, yet, after being strictly interrogated as to his
knowledge of his nephew’s places of concealment,
he was forced to take an oath against affording
him shelter, or holding any correspondence with
him, directly or indirectly, so long as he remained
under the ban of outlawry; he was also sworn to
afford the English all the information in his power,
in order that means might be taken for bringing
him to punishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
While Percy and his coadjutor were thus employed
at Glasgow, Wallace and his followers were concerting
measures, in the depths of Methven wood,
for an attack on a body of English troops which
were to leave St Johnstone on the day following;
in order to proceed to Kincleven Castle, headed
by an old veteran knight named Butler, who had
rendered himself peculiarly obnoxious to the Scots
by the cruelties which he had inflicted upon them.
Intelligence of this intended movement was communicated
to Wallace, who, having disguised himself
in the dress of a borderer, got introduced into
St Johnstone under the name of William Malcolmson.
The mayor, before whom he had to appear,
was so well pleased with his humorous conversation,
and the account which he gave of himself,
that he allowed him to go in search of the
employment he pretended to have come in quest
of. By this means he had all the facilities he
could desire for becoming acquainted with the
strength and condition of the garrison. Having
ascertained the intended removal of the troops alluded
to, he hastened back to his retreat in the
woods, where, sounding his horn, he rallied his
associates around him, and found them all willing
to engage in the enterprise.</p>

<p>Sir James Butler, who was esteemed one of the
bravest old warriors among the English, had on
this occasion about a hundred choice soldiers under
his command. With this force he was quietly
proceeding, amid the thick haze of the morning,
to reinforce the garrison of Kincleven, when, from
behind a rock that projected over the road, he was
suddenly assailed by the Scots. The confusion
occasioned by their unexpected attack, disconcerted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
the English commander, and before he could
recover his troops from their consternation, a fresh
charge threw them into complete disorder. The
strength and valour of the undaunted champion of
the Scots rendered the advantage which their enemies
possessed, in point of numbers, of little avail.
It must, however, be allowed, that the disparity in
this instance was not so great as in some previous
rencounters: Wallace, according to some accounts,
having near sixty hardy warriors under his command,
most part of whom had distinguished
themselves on former occasions. Kerlé or Kerle,
to whom he had presented the <i>mace</i> or staff of
steel, taken from the porter at the Peel of Gargunnock,
displayed on this occasion the most
determined bravery; his formidable weapon being
wielded with a dexterity which admirably seconded
the efforts of our hero. Sixteen of the English
had fallen beneath the swords of the Scots; but
when Wallace came in contact with Sir James
Butler, the conflict was of short duration. The old
veteran was no match for the young patriot; and
on seeing their chief fall beneath the arm of his adversary,
the rout of the English became general.
The disordered rabble fled in terror towards Kincleven,
from the battlements of which their discomfiture
had been observed; and those within
hastened to let down the drawbridge to receive
and shelter their flying countrymen. Onwards came
the confused mass of friends and foes,&mdash;the shouts
of the victors mingling with the cries of the vanquished,
and thundering over the drawbridge, the
pursued and their pursuers entered the castle together.
The few soldiers that were in the place
could render them but little assistance in making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
head against their enemies; and the whole, with
the exception of two priests, and some women and
children, were indiscriminately put to the sword.</p>

<p>Having cleared the place of the dead bodies
of the English, and taken precautions against
a surprise during the time they might remain,
they proceeded to search the castle, in which was
found a rich booty in money, besides a plentiful
stock of provisions and other stores. A part of
this valuable pillage they conveyed by night to
Shortwood Forest, where they prepared <span class="locked">pits<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></span> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
other places for its concealment, there to remain
as a resource against future emergencies.</p>

<p>The nonjurors under Wallace were not as yet
sufficiently numerous to enable him to put garrisons
in those fortresses which fell into his hands.
It was therefore wisely determined to demolish
every place of strength that was likely to afford
their enemies a footing in the country. Hardy
themselves, and inured to the inclemency of the
weather, they cared little for those comforts
which were indispensable to their more luxurious
neighbours. In summer, the forest spread
its leafy canopy over their slumbers; and, in winter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
their robust and sinewy frames felt little inconvenience,
though exposed, in their dens and
caverns, to all the rigour of the merciless elements.
Such men heard with indifference, and executed
with alacrity, the command which their leader
gave for the destruction of Kincleven Castle. After
securing that part of the iron work which might
be useful in their sylvan retreats, the remaining
furniture and lumber were formed into piles; and,
at the dead hour of night, the conflagration rose in
volumes to the sky. From the lateness of the
hour, and the secluded situation of the castle, its
fate remained unknown until the morning, when
the smoke, which continued to ascend from the
ruins, led the country people to the knowledge of
the desolating vengeance which had overtaken their
oppressors. The females, who had been allowed
to depart before the work of destruction commenced,
carried to St Johnstone the melancholy
account of their disaster.</p>

<p>The grief and indignation which were felt among
the English at St Johnstone, on hearing the doleful
recital of the slaughter of their countrymen,
induced Sir Gerald <span class="locked">Heron,<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></span> the governor, to allow
Sir John Butler, son of the forementioned Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
James, to follow the Scots with all the force of the
garrison, to revenge the death of his father. In
this undertaking he was joined by Sir William de
Lorayne, an officer of reputation, and a great favourite
with the soldiery.</p>

<p>Although the force under these leaders amounted
to nearly a thousand men, from the admirable
management of the Scottish chief, they were
kept in a great measure ignorant of their own vast
superiority. In the forest of Shortwood, a part of
which they endeavoured to invest, their provident
enemy had erected a number of rustic fortifications,
in the form of squares, communicating with each
other, the walls of which were made, by affixing
two rows of planks to the trees, and filling up the
space between with thorns. Each of these squares
had a small opening towards the enemy, and another
at the opposite side, for the purpose of retreat;
while the advance towards them was intersected
by defences, formed in a similar manner, in
order to break, and otherwise prevent the approach
of too great a body of the enemy. By this
means, when the Scots found themselves obliged
to retire for shelter to these intrenchments, they
could only be pursued in broken and straggling detachments.
These defences were not fully completed
when the English came in sight; and Wallace,
therefore, in order to gain time, appeared at a distant
and almost detached part of the wood with a
few of his followers, leaving the rest under the
command of Stephen of Ireland, to complete the
works. On the approach of the English, an arrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
from the powerful and unerring hand of our
hero, brought down one of their advanced-guard.
This had the effect of attracting their attention
towards that part of the wood where he had
stationed his little party, who also sent their arrows
among the English, though not with such
good effect as their chief, who continued to bring
down his man as they advanced. The enemy,
having observed the opening at which Wallace
made his appearance to discharge his deadly shafts,
sent forward one of the most expert of their Lancashire
bowmen to lie in wait for him, while the
rest directed their missiles at random toward
those parts where they conceived his men to be
stationed. It was not long before the eagerness
of Wallace betrayed him to the practised hand of
his watchful adversary, whose well-directed shaft,
after grazing the collar of steel which he usually
wore, stuck fast in the fleshy part of his neck.
His keen eye, however, soon discovered his lurking
foe; and, hurrying towards him, intercepted
his retreat, and slew him in front of his companions,
who were so struck with the boldness of the
deed, that not one of them attempted to oppose his
return to his associates. Although the Scots were
generally thought inferior to the English in the use
of the <span class="locked">bow,<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></span> on the present occasion, having the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
covering of the wood to shelter them from the
superior number and direct view of their adversaries,
they managed, by shifting their ground as
their enemies advanced, to keep up a kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
bush-fight till after noon; during which time fifteen
of the English had been slain by the hand
of Wallace, besides a considerable number by
his companions. Their arrows being all expended,
and having arrived at a part of the forest,
where a high cliff prevented their further
retreat, Sir William de Lorayne advanced upon
them with nearly three hundred men, while Sir
Gerald Heron and young Butler remained without
the forest, in order to prevent the escape
of any of the fugitives. Wallace had just time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
to make a short animating address to his companions;
and placing them so as to have the advantage
of the cliff as a protection to their rear,
they stood prepared for the onslaught. The
English were astonished to find themselves opposed
to so small a number of Scots as now appeared
waiting their attack, and conceived they
would have little else to do than to surround the
party and take them prisoners. The determined
valour, however, with which they received and
repulsed their repeated charges, convinced them
that the toils of the day were not yet over. Wallace,
who was always a tower of strength to his
friends in the hour of danger, displayed, on this
occasion, more than his usual heroism. While the
strength which nerved his resistless arm excited
the greatest enthusiasm among his followers, and
spread horror and dismay through the ranks of
their enemies, Sir William de Lorayne still urged
his men on to the conflict, and they as quickly receded,
when they found themselves opposed to
that champion of whose strength and exploits they
had heard so many appalling accounts. The battle,
however, still continued to rage with unabated
fury on both sides;&mdash;the English, eager to revenge
the slaughter of their countrymen, and the
Scots, frantic with the wrongs they had already
sustained, determined to conquer or die on the
spot. At this time their dauntless chief burst like
a thunderbolt amidst the thickest of the English;
and, having scattered them before him, ascended a
little hillock behind which they had retreated, and
applying his bugle-horn to his mouth, made the
woodlands resound with a bold and animating war-note.
The English leader, conceiving that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
was done in derision, rallied his forces, and again
advanced to the attack. Wallace and his few
hardy veterans were soon environed by their enraged
assailants, and the battle commenced anew
with all the rancour of their former animosities.
Though the Scots fought with the most inflexible
obstinacy, yet some of them, from the severity of
their wounds, appeared unable to continue much
longer the unequal contest; but at this critical
juncture, Stephen of Ireland, and his party, in
obedience to the signal sounded by their chief,
suddenly emerged from the brush-wood, and
fell upon the rear of the enemy with determined
ferocity. Surprised and dismayed at so unexpected
an attack, the English fled in the greatest
confusion, followed by the victors, who continued
the pursuit, making dreadful carnage among them,
till they reached the boundary of the forest. Here
the terrified fugitives were met by Sir John Butler,
at the head of five hundred men. This accession
of force obliged the Scots, in their turn, to
retreat to their defences&mdash;the first of which was
carried by the enemy, but at the expense of a
considerable number of the bravest of their warriors.
The English had now the mortification to
find that their opponents had only retired to a second
enclosure, from which Wallace, supported by
Cleland, Boyd, and a few of the most resolute
of his companions, made a sortie, in which, after
killing a considerable number, Wallace came in
contact with the knight of Lorayne, and at one
blow clove him to the chin. His terrified followers
shrunk aghast from the ponderous weapon
of their gigantic adversary; but urged on
by Butler, to revenge the death of their leader,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
they again crowded round the little band of heroes.
Again they were dispersed; and Butler,
who had been foremost in the attack, came within
reach of the sword of the Scottish champion,
which descended with a force that would have cut
him to the ground, had not the intervening branch
of a tree saved him from the blow, and his men,
rushing forward to his assistance, carried him off
before it could be repeated. According to some
accounts, Butler is said to have been first wounded,
and that Sir William de Lorayne was slain in
attempting to rescue him from his perilous situation.
Whatever may have been the case, the English
were so discouraged by the loss of one leader,
and the disabling of the other, that they hastily
fell back upon the troops left at the entrance of
the forest under Sir Gerald Heron. Here a council
of war was held, wherein it was proposed to
make a simultaneous attack on the defences of the
Scots. During the discussion, however, which
ensued on the manner of carrying the proposal
into effect, Wallace and his companions escaped
by the opposite side of the forest, and retreated to
Cargyle wood, a situation which afforded them
more natural advantages in securing themselves
from their numerous assailants.</p>

<p>The English, on the retreat of the Scots, now commenced
a strict search after the booty taken from
Kincleven Castle. Nothing, however, could be
discovered, save the favourite steed of old Butler,
which had been left behind in one of the enclosures.
On this his wounded son was placed, and
the whole cavalcade returned fatigued and dispirited
to St Johnstone, leaving one hundred and
twenty of their companions dead behind them. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
the Scots, seven were killed, and the rest more or
less injured.</p>

<p>From an elevated situation, Wallace had observed
the English as they retired to St Johnstone;
and, though still smarting from the wounds he had
received, returned at midnight to the scene of action
with a number of his companions, and dug up
the most valuable part of the concealed plunder,
which they conveyed to their new retreat, along
with whatever arms or other booty the light of the
moon enabled them to strip from the dead bodies
that lay scattered around them.</p>

<p>A few days after the above rencounter, Wallace
is said to have returned to St Johnstone in the
disguise of a priest; and a story is told of his having
been betrayed by a female, with whom he had
become acquainted during his former visit to that
place. Repenting, however, of the information
she had given his enemies, she disclosed the danger
that awaited him just in time to effect his escape.
His foes, enraged at the disappointment,
again set off in pursuit of him, taking along with
them a <span class="locked">slough-hound<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></span> to assist them in discovering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
his retreats. A sanguinary battle was again fought,
in which Wallace lost nine of his remaining followers,
and the English leader about one hundred.</p>

<p>In this retreat of the Scots, their chief is also said
to have slain one of his followers, named Fawdon,
an Irishman, whom he suspected of treachery. Of
this man, Blind Harry gives the following unprepossessing
description:</p>

<p>On the first view of the case, there appears a
degree of barbarity in the conduct of Wallace,
which is quite at variance with that affection and
tenderness which he had uniformly displayed towards
his adherents; and we cannot help condemning
the sternness of that policy which could
thus deprive a follower of his life, because worn
out with toil, and disabled by wounds, he could
no longer keep up with his companions. But, on
reflection, we find the lives of Wallace, and of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
few that remained of the party, placed in jeopardy
by one, who, from his reluctance to make a little
farther exertion, when assured that a place of
safety was at hand, gave good grounds to suspect
that he had become unsound at the core. We may
also remark, that being acquainted with the spot
where the plunder taken from the English was
concealed, Wallace had an additional reason to
suspect Fawdon’s motives for wishing to be left
behind; and it may be urged in support of the justice
of this suspicion, that his countryman Stephen,
who introduced him to the little band of
patriots, remained the firm and confidential friend
of Wallace through all his difficulties. This he
certainly would not have done, had Wallace, on
<i>slight</i> grounds, inflicted death on one who was
not only his friend and countryman, but in some
degree under his protection. So far, indeed, was
Stephen from feeling dissatisfaction at the conduct
of Wallace, that he and Kerle lingered behind,
and, favoured by the shades of night, which
had now set in, mingled with the enemy; and
while their general, Sir Gerald Heron, was in
the act of stooping to examine the body of Fawdon,
whose blood had arrested the progress of
the slough-hound, Kerle watched the opportunity,
and gave him a mortal stab in the throat with his
dagger. The cry of “Treason!” arose among the
English; but, in the confusion, the two confederates
slipped down unobserved among the underwood
that surrounded them, and made the best
of their way towards Loch Earne, the well-wooded
banks of which afforded them every chance of security.
In the interval, Wallace, and thirteen
of his followers, all that were now left him, made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
good their retreat to the deserted Castle of Gask
situated in the middle of a wood. This place
possessed few advantages that could recommend
it as a desirable retreat; but, to men in their
desperate situation, the prospect of shelter from
the swords of their pursuers was a considerable
relief, and though it appeared in a sad state of
dilapidation, a number of the apartments were entire;
and the courtyard was surrounded by a wall
of great thickness, which, broken as it might be
in some parts, would nevertheless enable them to
make a tolerable defence. With this expectation,
therefore, they determined to secure themselves
for the night, and trust to their good swords for a
path through their enemies in the morning.</p>

<span class="subhead">SINGULAR ADVENTURE OF WALLACE IN GASK CASTLE.&mdash;KILLS
THE ENGLISH LEADER.&mdash;ESCAPES TO TORWOOD.&mdash;INTERVIEW
WITH HIS UNCLE.</span></h2>

<p>After the confusion produced by the death of
the English leader had subsided, a party of forty
men were despatched with the dead body to St
Johnstone; and Butler, who had so far recovered
from his wound as to be able to take the field
under Sir Gerald, remained, with about five hundred
men, to look after the fugitives. With this
force he proceeded to secure all the neighbouring
passes, and to take such other methods as he
thought would prevent their escape.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Wallace and his few remaining
friends had put their place of refuge in as good
a state of defence as its ruinous condition would
admit; and having procured a sheep from a neighbouring
fold, they kindled a fire in the courtyard,
and prepared for their evening repast. Wallace
now wisely considered, from the fatigue his
followers had undergone during the day, that however
much they might stand in want of refreshment,
a few hours repose would be absolutely
necessary for recruiting their wearied and exhausted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
spirits, and rendering them fit for the arduous
enterprise that awaited them in the morning.
As soon, therefore, as they had allayed their
hunger, he ordered them to betake themselves to
rest, while he undertook to keep watch by himself.</p>

<p>Surrounded by his sleeping companions, with
no light but what the expiring embers afforded,
the mind of Wallace became overshadowed with
melancholy forebodings. Though in the late conflicts
he had destroyed a great number of the
enemy, his own little band had been almost annihilated;
and, in his present situation, he saw
little probability of filling up their places with
men on whom he could put the same dependence.
Two of his most devoted partisans, Stephen
and Kerle, had disappeared; and he had every
reason to suppose they were either slain, or fallen
into the hands of the enemy. The apathy with
which the most powerful of the nobility continued
to witness the exertions of himself and his followers
for the independence of their country, filled
him with grief and indignation; while, from the
loss of so many brave friends in the late encounter,
he was apprehensive his few remaining companions
would now consider their undertaking as
desperate. These reflections, aided by the consideration
that he was actually surrounded by a
force against which his expectations of success could
not be very sanguine, tended to excite the most
gloomy apprehensions.</p>

<p>From this state of mind, he was suddenly aroused
by the blowing of <span class="locked">horns,<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></span> mingled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
frightful yells, which seemed to proceed from a
rising ground in the neighbourhood. Two of his
party were despatched to ascertain the cause of the
uproar; but these not returning, and the alarm
still increasing, other scouts were sent out, till
Wallace was at last left alone, without any one to
assist in the defence of the place, if it should happen
to be attacked.</p>

<p>It was now past midnight; and the flame that
still lingered about the remains of the almost extinguished
faggots, continued, at intervals, to throw
its pale and flickering light on the ruinous walls of
the castle, when Wallace was suddenly startled by
the shadow of a human figure. Though broken and
indistinct at first, yet the moon, which was slowly
emerging from behind a cloud, rendered it every
moment more apparent. From the feet to the
shoulders, which was all of it that was visible,
it seemed to be of uncommon dimensions; and
what more particularly rivetted the attention of
the forlorn chief, a human head hung dangling
from its hand, in a manner that gave it the appearance
of something supernatural. While gazing
with intense anxiety on this singular object, its
hand was slowly raised, and the head, which it
held, after striking the helmet of Wallace, fell
with considerable violence among the dying embers
before him. Snatching it up, he discovered,
by the light of the moon, the pale and ghastly features<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
of the “ill-fated Fawdon;” and, turning towards
the place from whence it was thrown, he
observed the figure of a man endeavouring to descend
by a broken part of the wall. In the excitement
of the moment, he hurled the head after
it, and, drawing his sword, hastened from the castle
in pursuit of the strange intruder.</p>

<p>Henry, or his authority, in narrating the above
circumstance, gives way to the popular belief of
his time, and describes it as the real apparition of
the late faithless associate; but this evidently arises
from that love for the marvellous peculiar to the
age. When stripped of the poetical embellishments
with which it is clothed, the story simply
appears to have been this:&mdash;The English, on coming
to the headless body of Fawdon, naturally conceived
that the Scots had quarrelled among themselves;
and some one thinking it probable, from
the size, that the deceased might be Wallace, for
whose head a considerable reward was offered, took
care to secure the prize. The impatience of Butler
for revenge made him think of a night-attack,
provided they could discover the enemy; and the
horns, therefore, which had been taken from those
Scots who had fallen in the conflict, were made
use of as a <i>ruse</i> to entrap them into the belief,
that it was a party of their countrymen coming to
their assistance. The soldier, who had got the
head into his possession, appears to have been one
of the scouts sent in search of the fugitives; and no
doubt, eager to ascertain the value of his capture,
had ventured forward with more confidence than
his companions. Disappointment at finding the
Scottish chief alive, no doubt, induced him to throw
the head; and the terror which his name inspired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
made him likewise think it prudent to effect his
retreat.</p>

<p>Though the horns still continued to sound, Wallace
was too cautious to reply, but wandered about
the forest, searching in silence for his lost companions.
His efforts, however, were unavailing;
and, at the dawn of the morning, he found himself
on the verge of the forest. Here he was observed
by Butler, who had rode out to view the
posts. Dissatisfied with the answer returned to his
challenge, the English leader drew his sword, and
urged forward his steed. Wallace advancing from
under the shade, which partly concealed him, Butler
saw, with astonishment, the formidable foe he was in
quest of, and prepared to fall back on his nearest
position. His retreat, however, was anticipated by
a blow which struck him from the saddle, and, before
he could recover himself, the sword of his
powerful antagonist had levelled him with the dust.
Our hero had just reached the stirrup of his fallen
enemy, when he observed an Englishman, armed
cap-a-pee, advancing in full career towards him,
with his spear in rest. By a dexterous management
of his horse, he avoided the stroke; and
whilst his foe, unable to recover himself, was hurrying
past, he lent him a blow on the neck, which
sent him headlong to the ground. The alarm was
now spread among the English, whom Wallace observed
collecting from various quarters to intercept
his retreat. Giving the rein to his charger, he shot
like an arrow through a straggling party of horse
that seemed the least formidable, but who, on recovering
from their surprise, set off in full pursuit,
followed by the whole of their force.</p>

<p>Though, from his superior knowledge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
country, Wallace was frequently enabled to distance
his pursuers; yet the keenness with which
they kept up the chase, obliged him several times
to turn and act on the offensive. As this was always
done in situations where he could not be
surrounded, those that were most forward paid
dearly for their temerity; whilst the suddenness
and fury of his repeated attacks spread a panic
to the rear of his enemy, from the idea that he
had met a reinforcement of his countrymen. Before
the shades of evening had set in, twenty of
the English were strewed along the line of his retreat;
and those who were foremost, had become
very cautious in approaching within reach of his
arm. A rising part of the ground had, for some
time, hid him from their view; and when they
again came in sight of him, he appeared leading
his jaded and breathless steed up a steep and rugged
pass between two craggy precipices. Though
he was soon again obscured in the shades of twilight,
from the exhausted state of his horse,
they saw little probability of his being able to effect
his escape. Having with difficulty followed
in his tract, they found, on descending a precipitous
defile, an extensive morass spread before them,
far as the eye could penetrate, at the edge of which
lay the steed of their late commander, expiring
from the wounds and fatigue it had encountered;
but the object of their pursuit was nowhere to be
seen. Strong picquets were sent out in every direction,
but all their exertions were fruitless; and
they returned at midnight to their head-quarters,
without obtaining the slightest trace of the fugitive.</p>

<p>It has been mentioned, in the early part of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
history, that the juvenile years of our hero were
spent with a brother of his father, a wealthy ecclesiastic
at Dunipace in Stirlingshire. Though
he was withdrawn from the protection of this relative
at an early age, yet he had been long enough
under his roof to endear himself to all the servants
and dependants. One of the former, a widow,
now lived with her three sons in a secluded part
of the Torwood, then an extensive forest in Stirlingshire.
In the cottage of this woman, Wallace
had in former emergencies found a place of concealment
from his enemies; and on this occasion,
about the dead hour of night, the faithful inmates
were startled by the well-known signal at the window.
Never did their heroic guest appear before
them in greater distress; exhausted from fatigue,
faint with hunger, his armour encrusted with
blood, and every part of his dress drenched with
water, showed the hardships and perils he had
undergone.</p>

<p>After quitting his pursuers at the morass, he
had, by a passage unknown to them, crossed over
to the other side, and made the best of his way
towards the Forth. A large force of the enemy,
however, occupied Stirling, and he was therefore
compelled to take the river at Camskenneth. After
much difficulty, from the weight of his armour,
he succeeded in gaining the opposite bank, and
proceeded forward on his journey, satisfied that he
had got considerably the start of his pursuers.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of the house where he
had now taken refuge, was an <span class="locked">oak<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></span> of huge dimensions,
in a cavity of which he had frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
concealed himself from his enemies, when the
search was too close to allow of his remaining
within doors. To this retreat he now repaired, after
partaking of that refreshment which his situation
so much required. One of the widow’s sons
was despatched to acquaint his uncle with his
safety, and to request his assistance; while another
was sent off towards the scene of his late conflicts,
to obtain, if possible, some intelligence of his lost
companions.</p>

<p>The morning was pretty far advanced, when Wallace
was awakened from his sleep by the sound of
voices, and, starting to his feet, found his uncle and
two of the widow’s sons engaged in conversation,
one of whom had been watching him during his
sleep. His uncle, taking him by the arm, led him
apart from the others, and began to inquire into
his situation, representing to him, at the same time,
the difficulties he was still likely to experience if
he continued to persevere in so hopeless a cause.
“Your followers,” added he, “are now either slain
or dispersed, and all your efforts in the district you
have been in, have not procured you a single friend
to replace those you have lost; the plunder you
have taken has either been recaptured, or left in
places where it would be madness to hazard yourself
in regaining it. Besides, were you even successful,
to your utmost wish, in expelling the English
from our country, do you believe that so powerful,
so ambitious a prince as Edward, one who
is considered the most accomplished warrior of his
age, would allow the laurels to be torn from his
brow by the son of an obscure Scottish laird?
Would not the whole force of his mighty kingdom,
assisted, if necessary, by his foreign auxiliaries and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
vassals, be poured upon our devoted country?
Would not the inhuman butcheries which were
witnessed at Berwick be again renewed in all our
cities? Have we not already had too much experience
of his cruelty, to think of increasing our
misfortunes by fresh provocations? Listen, therefore,
my dear son, to what I am authorized to propose
to you. You are aware, that those men,
whose duty and interest it was to have defended
our country, have submitted to our enemies; if
you will, therefore, give over your fruitless hostility
to Edward, and acknowledge him as your
liege Lord you will, in place of skulking from covert
to covert, have it in your power to become
the most powerful vassal of his crown.”</p>

<p>Before his uncle had time to explain, Wallace
withdrew his arm from his grasp. “My situation,”
said he, “is gloomy enough, but not so
desperate as you imagine. I regret nothing that
has yet happened, save the loss of my gallant
friends; but I know where the sound of my horn
can still call forth as many resolute spirits as
will enable me to revenge their fall. Those who
have joined me, know that the liberty of our country
is the only object I have in view; and they
also know, that I have always been as ready to
expose my own life as theirs in the quarrel. The
liberty which an unprincipled usurper is endeavouring
to deprive us of, is the birthright we have
inherited from our ancestors, and which belongs to
our posterity, to whom it is our duty to transmit
it. If we perish in doing so, we perish in doing
what is right; and that God, who made us free
men, will avert the scenes you dread, if we show
ourselves worthy of his gift. If, on the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
we basely surrender what we only hold in trust
for our children, the galling yoke of slavery will
be a just retribution for defrauding them of their
sacred inheritance. As to the proposal, come from
whom it may, you can acquaint them, that the
destruction of a single enemy of my country’s independence
affords me more pleasure than all the
wealth which our proud oppressor has it in his
power to bestow. Have you forgot, uncle,” said
he, while his stern features relaxed into a smile almost
sarcastic&mdash;“have you forgot</p>

<p class="in0 in4">
“Dico tibi verum, libertas optima rerum:<br />

<p class="in0">“have you forgot those sentiments which you was

days of my <span class="locked">childhood,<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></span> when peace was in
all our borders, and every man sat under his own
vine and fig-tree, enjoying the fatherly protection
of a righteous sovereign? And is there to be no effort,
no sacrifice made to bring again those days
to our poor distracted country?” He was proceeding,
when the old man’s eyes became suffused,
recollections of the past crowded upon his mind,
and he threw himself on the breast of his nephew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
While Wallace was thus engaged with his venerable
relative, he was agreeably surprised to see
his two friends, Kerle and Stephen, advancing towards
him, accompanied by a son of his kind hostess.
After mutual congratulations and expressions
of joy, for the unexpected meeting, had
passed between them, they communicated to each
other the particulars of the events that had taken
place since their separation; and, after receiving
the benediction of the priest, and returning thanks
to the Virgin, they retired to consult about their
future operations.</p>

<span class="subhead">WALLACE JOINED BY SIR JOHN GRAHAM.&mdash;PROCEEDINGS IN
CLYDESDALE.&mdash;WALLACE VISITS LANARK.&mdash;ADVENTURE WITH
A PARTY OF THE ENGLISH.</span></h2>

<p>It appears, that an oath similar to that which Sir
Raynald Crawford had been compelled to take,
against holding correspondence with, or affording
assistance to Wallace, had also been forced
upon his other relatives, as we find the widow alluded
to in the foregoing chapter made the instrument
of conveying to him the proofs of his uncle’s
affection.</p>

<p>Having, by her means, been supplied with a
considerable sum of money, as well as horses for
himself and his companions, they set forward, accompanied
by two of her sons whom she devoted
to the cause, toward those districts where they
had reason to expect a more cordial co-operation,
than what they had experienced in the neighbourhood
of St Johnstone.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of his uncle, Wallace visited
Dundaff Castle, on his way towards Clydesdale.
This fortress, with the lands of Dundaff,
Strathblane and Strathcarron, belonged to
Sir David, or according to others, to Sir John
Graham, an old warrior, who, in his early years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
had recommended himself by his gallantry to
Alexander, Lord High Steward of Scotland, by
whom he is supposed to have been intrusted with an
important command at the battle of Largs. His
son and heir, Sir John, received, when but a stripling,
the honour of knighthood at Berwick, on account
of his conduct in a border feud with the
Percys of Northumberland. During three days
which Wallace passed at Dundaff, he and his companions
experienced the most unbounded hospitality;
and the old chieftain saw, with delight, those
feelings of admiration and friendship with which
his son and their noble guest appeared to view each
other. Before the departure of the latter, Sir
John, with the consent of his father, devoted himself
to the cause of his country’s independence, by
swearing fidelity to Wallace as his chief, and would
have instantly accompanied him, but it was deemed
more prudent to remain with his father, till
he was apprised of the number of followers Wallace
could muster in Clydesdale. Meantime, he
was to hold himself in readiness to advance,
with his father’s vassals, as soon as he should
receive intimation. After mutual expressions of
friendship, Wallace proceeded on his journey,
and lodged the same night at Bothwell, in the
house of one Crawford, from whom he received
information of the state of the country and
the strength of the enemy. The following night
he reached Gillbank, in the neighbourhood of Lanark,
where he remained with a near relation of
his own; and from thence he despatched Stephen
and Kerle, one to the west, and the other to the
north, to acquaint his friends of his situation, and
appoint a time and place to meet him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
It seems about this time a report had been circulated
among the English, that Wallace had been
slain in a mutiny of his followers. This rumour, no
doubt occasioned by the circumstances attending
the death of Fawdon, had reached Percy, along
with the accounts of the destruction of Kincleven
Castle, and the slaughter of Butler and the other
English officers; but though he did not give it
implicit belief, there was a degree of credit attached
to it, particularly by the English in the upper
part of Clydesdale, that caused our hero to be
less taken notice of when he appeared among
them. This was particularly serviceable to him in the
visits which he now made to Lanark. We have
already alluded to an attachment which Wallace
entertained for a young gentlewoman of that place.
A degree of obscurity hangs over the history of
this amour. It is supposed, by those writers who
have taken notice of the subject, that the parties
had been privately married shortly after the battle
of Beg, during the time that he remained in
the forest of Clydesdale, and that the ceremony
was performed by John Blair, but whether in the
church, or under the “Greenwood Tree,” is no
where stated. Be that as it may, his situation was
too precarious to allow him to remove her from
her present residence. His visits were, therefore,
made with the utmost secrecy, in such disguises,
and at such hours, as would best enable
him to escape the notice of his enemies. Meanwhile
his sword was not allowed to rust. He
and his companions were continually on the watch
for stragglers from the English quarters; and as
they always attacked them in situations where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
none could escape, their mysterious disappearance
excited the greatest alarm among their countrymen.
Various anecdotes are still in circulation
among the peasantry of the Upper Ward of Lanarkshire,
regarding exploits performed by him
about this time. Among others, there is a story
still handed down, of the severe retaliation he inflicted
on a party of Englishmen, who, having come
to the same inn at which he and his companions
were refreshing themselves, had played off a barbarous
attempt at waggery, by cutting the tails
from the horses of the Scots. Blind Harry alludes
to this circumstance; and the following address,
which Wallace is represented as having
made to their captain, before he cut him down,
may be considered as no unfavourable specimen of
the humour of the man:</p>

<p>According to some accounts, the above transactions
is said to have occurred at Lochmaben, and
that he was afterwards pursued by Sir Hew of
Moreland, who traced the Scots to the Knock-wood
by the blood that still continued to issue from their
horses. Wallace being here joined by sixteen of
his followers who had been lurking in the wood,
an engagement commenced, in which, though
greatly superior in numbers, the English were defeated,
and Sir Hew, with near twenty of his men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
were slain. This account is confirmed by a tradition
still current in the neighbourhood; and is
thus mentioned in the Statistical Account of the
Parish of Kirkmichael. “There are several indistinct
remains of ancient fortifications, but no
tradition about any other than a small fort in the
Knock-wood, called Wallace’s house, said to have
been thrown up by Sir William Wallace after he had
slain Sir Hew of Moreland and five of his men, at a
place still named from that event, the ‘<i>Sax Corses</i>,’
i. e. the six corpses, and where there are two or
three large stones which seem to have been set up
in remembrance of some great transaction.” Tradition
may be generally relied on when it marks
the spot where any remarkable occurrence has taken
place; yet the circumstances connected with it are
often mis-stated. The rude defence alluded to,
under the name of Wallace’s House, may have been
either hastily formed during the advance of Moreland
and his party&mdash;as they are said to have been
seen for some time before they reached the position
occupied by the Scots&mdash;or possibly it may be
the remains of some strength used in former wars.
Wallace only seems to have availed himself of it
to protect, for the moment, his little band from being
overpowered by their numerous assailants; for
we find him immediately after this victory obliged
to quit Knock-wood. Those Englishmen who escaped,
having fled to Lochmaben Castle, a detachment
of three hundred horse were ordered to go in pursuit,
under the command of one Graystock, an officer
who had lately arrived from England with a
strong reinforcement to fill up the deficiencies
which Wallace had made in the garrisons. Ignorant
in a great measure of the talents and prowess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
of the man he had to contend with, he upbraided
his fugitive countrymen with cowardice, when they
recommended caution to him in operations against
so wary an adversary, and bent on chastising what
he termed the insolence of the freebooter, pressed
forward with the greatest expedition.</p>

<p>The Scots having supplied themselves with the
horses of their slain enemies, were preparing to
advance into Clydesdale, near the confines of
which Wallace had appointed to meet his trusty
associates, Kerle and Stephen, with those friends
who had promised to join him, when the formidable
array of Graystock came in sight, at full gallop.
Wallace now ordered his men to form, and retire
with deliberation, taking care to keep their horses
in breath, while he remained in the rear to repress
any sudden attack that might be made. As
the enemy advanced, Wallace, mounted on the
horse of Moreland, kept in front of them, and rode,
with so much <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sang froid</i>, occasionally looking
over his shoulder, that an uninterested spectator
might have supposed he was rather leading the
English party on, than watching for a favourable
opportunity of attacking them, while the terror of
his name prevented any of them from moving from
their ranks. They had thus contrived to follow the
retreating Scots for some time, when Graystock
ordered a movement, by which he imagined he
would be able to surround Wallace and his
little band. At this juncture Sir John Graham
suddenly appeared with about thirty horse, followed
by Sir Roger Kilpatrick of Torthorowald, a near
relation of Wallace by the mother’s side, who, in
obedience to the message by the faithful Stephen,
had taken the field with twenty of his tenantry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
Wallace received these worthy confederates with
three cheers, and instantly set them an example,
by charging through the centre of the enemy: his
friends having put themselves in array, pushed
forward at their utmost speed, and soon completed
the confusion he had commenced. The left
wing of the enemy was thrown into disorder
before the impetuous charge of the Scots; and
Sir John Graham was busily employed in pursuing
and cutting down the fugitives, when Wallace
came up with him, and represented the impropriety
of killing the common soldiers while
their leaders were escaping; pointing out to him
a body of one hundred of the enemy, which Graystock
was endeavouring to keep entire, and recommended,
as his horse were still in good condition,
to charge and disperse them. Sir John
quickly arranged his little squadron, and prepared
with alacrity to execute the commands he had received.
Wallace, who seldom gave orders which
he did not see executed, was soon in the fray. The
charge of Graham had been too impetuous to be
withstood. Wallace found the enemy in confusion,
and Graystock engaged hand to hand
with the young knight of Dundaff. The conflict
for a few moments remained doubtful, but the superior
strength and dexterity of Graham soon became
apparent; and the fall of the English leader
was the signal of flight for his followers, who
sought refuge in the place whence the Scots had
been lately driven.</p>

<p>The victors were hastily recalled from the pursuit
by the horn of their chief. Having collected
them around him, he complimented them on the
valour they had displayed, and proposed that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
should instantly attack the Castle of Lochmaben;
representing to them, that as the garrison had already
been put to flight, if they could reach it
before the fugitives returned, the plunder they
might find would amply reward the labours they
had undergone. The proposal was joyfully received;
and they instantly set out under the guidance
of a person well acquainted with the intricacies of
the country.</p>

<p>As their chief expected, the fortress had been
left to the care of the porter and a few invalids,
who were easily overpowered; and this place
they found well stored with abundance of every
thing their situation required. While enjoying
themselves after the fatigues of the day, the remains
of their discomfited enemies were observed
hastening towards the castle. Orders being immediately
given for their admission, on reaching
the castle-yard, they were surrounded by the
Scots, and, after a short conflict, indiscriminately
put to the sword.</p>

<p>The fortress, which had thus unexpectedly
fallen into their hands, was deemed so important
an acquisition, that Wallace thought it advisable to
leave a garrison in it. He then took his departure,
accompanied by Sir John Graham, Kerle,
Stephen, and a few other worthies, for the forest
of Clydesdale.</p>

WITH THE ENGLISH.&mdash;MURDER OF THE HEIRESS OF LAMINGTON.&mdash;HER
DEATH REVENGED.&mdash;THE ENGLISH DRIVEN
OUT OF LANARK.</span></h2>

<p>The Castle of Lochmaben is supposed to have
been the first fortress in which Wallace ventured
to place a garrison; and it is probable he was enabled
to do so, in consequence of a great many in
the neighbourhood having joined his standard, encouraged
no doubt by his late successes. This
supposition is confirmed by the circumstance of his
leaving behind him a few of those who had been
in the engagement with Graystock.</p>

<p>While the insurrection was thus spreading in
Scotland, Edward was prosecuting his views against
France. The accounts of the proceedings of Wallace
occasionally reached him, and arrested his attention
in the midst of his victories; and though
he felt no immediate apprehension from the attempts
of the freebooter, as he was pleased to call
the patriotic leader of the Scots, yet he considered
him such an enemy as it was not altogether prudent
to neglect.</p>

<p>The applications, therefore, which were made
from time to time, by Percy and others intrusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
with the management of Scottish affairs, were
promptly attended to, and the requisite supplies
forwarded to the different garrisons. Part of these
supplies, as has been already hinted, had reached
Lochmaben before the late rencounter; most of
the other fortified places had received their quota;
and the garrison of the Castle of Crawford were
in daily expectation of their proportion.</p>

<p>This fortress, which had belonged to the maternal
ancestors of <span class="locked">Wallace,<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></span> attracted his attention.
Having learned, from a female whom he
stopped on the moor, that the garrison, which consisted
of about twenty men, were carousing in an
hostelry in the neighbourhood of the castle, he proposed
to Sir John Graham to attempt a surprise.
For this purpose, he directed Graham to follow
slowly with the others under his command, while,
with a companion, he went forward himself to observe
the condition of the revellers. On approaching
the door, the language within had become sufficiently
audible; and he soon ascertained that he
and his exploits were the subject of discussion;
their captain, one Martindale, in the heat of his
pot-valour, declaring to his men the pleasure which
the presence of Wallace would afford him. Finding
himself in request, the fearless Scot stepped
forward. The “Benedicities” on both sides were
brief. Wallace plied his weapon with his usual
effect; and, aided by his companion, the maudlin
braggadocio and his fellows were soon overpowered.
Meanwhile, Sir John Graham, who
had reached the door during the contest, was ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
off to secure the <span class="locked">castle;<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></span> which duty, from
the small number of its defenders, he easily performed.</p>

<p>Having burnt the castle, and divided the spoil
among his followers, Wallace retired to Lanark,
on purpose, it is supposed, to concert measures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
for withdrawing from that place the object of his
affections, and placing her in some retreat less exposed
to the exactions of Hazelrig.</p>

<p>On this occasion, our hero, for the more effectually
disguising <span class="locked">himself,<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></span> had thrown a green mantle
over his armour, which he fastened with a belt,
from which depended his sword. At the entrance
of the town, his dress, and particularly the uncommon
length of his sword, attracted the notice
of some of the soldiers belonging to the garrison;
and one of them, more insolent than the others,
made a snatch at it. Wallace evaded the attempt
to deprive him of his weapon; when a <span class="locked">sarcastic<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></span>
dialogue ensued, which soon ended in blows; and
the English, seeing their companion no match for
the Scot, rushed forward to his assistance. Hemmed
in on all sides, Wallace became roused into
fury, and dealt his blows around him with fearful
and destructive energy. His ponderous blade descended
with rapid and crashing effect among the
bucklers and head-pieces of the enemy, who had begun
to retire in confusion, before his irresistible arm;
when others arriving, who were unacquainted with
the foe they had to contend with, rushed headlong
to the fray. Experience, however, soon taught them
to be more cautious in their advance; and Wallace
had set them completely at bay, when young
Hazelrig came on with a fresh party to their assistance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
Thus re-inforced, and eager to revenge
their companions, they were now fast gathering
round our hero, when a door facing him suddenly
opened, and a fair hand beckoned him from the
<i>melée</i>. Wallace quickly embraced the means of
escape thus afforded him; and the door being instantly
shut against his enemies, gave him an opportunity
of saving himself by an outlet behind the
house.</p>

<p>Old <span class="locked">Hazelrig,<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></span> or, as Wyntown calls him, the
Sheriff, was not in Lanark at the time of this affray;
but, on hearing the account of it, and learning
the number of English who had been killed,
he hastened to town, and caused the fair orphan
of Lamington to be brought before him. On discovering
her connection with Wallace, and the assistance
she had so opportunely afforded him, in a
paroxysm of rage and disappointment, he ordered
her for instant execution.</p>

<p>In the account of this affair, we have adhered
to the statement of <span class="locked">Wyntown,<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></span> who adds, that
Wallace, from a place of concealment, had the
heart-rending misfortune to be a spectator of the
execution of his mistress, without having the power
of attempting a rescue. This would not have
been the case, if he had, as the Minstrel says,
been attended by Sir John Graham, and twenty-four
of his associates. Wyntown represents
it as a mere personal adventure of Wallace; and
states, that, <i>after</i> the melancholy catastrophe, he
went in search of his friends, to assist him in revenging
the atrocity. Having collected thirty of
his followers, he returned with them, for that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
purpose, to Lanark. At the dead hour of night,
the door of the sheriff’s apartment was burst from
its hinges, and the iron-grasp of Wallace awakened
Hazelrig from his sleep. On being dragged headlong
to the street, after a stern reproof for his
cowardly conduct, the trembling victim instantly
received the reward due to his villany. The alarm
now spread, and the garrison soon engaged with
Wallace and his party; but deeply incensed at the
late disgusting act of barbarity, the people of Lanark
rose <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">en masse</i> against their oppressors, who,
unable to stand their ground, were soon overpowered,
and driven with great slaughter from the
town.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Lanark, having thus identified
themselves with the cause of Wallace, saw no alternative
left them, but to join heart and hand with
the avenger of their country’s wrongs; and the
number that now flocked to his standard enabled
him to take the field openly, and bid defiance to
the enemy. Indeed, so formidable was the force
under his command, that he met and defeated
a considerable body of the English in a regular
engagement in the neighbourhood of Biggar. It
has been alleged, that, on this memorable occasion,
Edward commanded in person; but such could
not have been the case, as the English monarch
was not in the country at the time. That a considerable
battle was fought in the neighbourhood,
there is reason to believe, as well from current
tradition, as from the number of <i>tumuli</i> which are
still to be seen. In the statistical account of Biggar,
the subject is thus taken notice of:&mdash;“At the west
end of the town is a tumulus, which appears never to
have been opened; and there are vestiges of three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
camps, each of a roundish figure, at different places
in the neighbourhood. There is a tradition of
a battle having been fought at the east of the town,
between the Scots, under Sir William Wallace,
and the English, who were said to be sixty thousand
strong, wherein a great slaughter was made
on both sides, especially among the latter.”</p>

<p>These accounts, however, are decidedly at variance
with truth, both in regard to the amount of
the English, and the person who commanded. It
is more probable, that the enemy did not exceed
eight, or at most ten thousand men, part of which
appears to have been under the command of Roden,
Lord de Whichenour. On the side of the
Scots, Sir Walter <span class="locked">Newbigging,<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></span> already referred
to, headed a body of cavalry. His son David, a
youth, at that time little more than fifteen years
of age, held a command under him, and the well-tried
military talents of the father were not disgraced
by the efforts of the young patriot, whose
conduct on this occasion was afterwards rewarded
by the honour of knighthood, probably conferred
by the hand of our hero himself. The family of
Newbigging, as has already been noticed, came
originally from England; and Sir Walter and his
son, on this occasion, found themselves opposed
to their near kinsman, the Lord of Whichenour.</p>

<p>At the head of what might now be called an
army, Wallace kept the field; and the celerity of
his movements confounded all the calculations of
the enemy. While the main body of his forces
appeared in their formidable intrenchments, occupying
the attention of the English, distant garrisons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
were surprised, and put to the sword by
foes, who seemed to spring up as it were within
their walls, and of whose approach they had not
the slightest intimation.</p>

<p>About this time, one of those iniquitous acts,
so often met with in the cold-blooded and relentless
policy of Edward, was perpetrated at Ayr,
against the barons and gentry of the west of Scotland.
This part of the country had been the nucleus,
as it were, of the insurrection; and the ill-disposed
and well-affected had now become equally
objects of suspicion to the usurper’s government.
Under the pretext of holding a Justice-Aire, they
were summoned to attend; and those who appeared
(among whom were Sir Raynald Crawford,
Sir Bryce <span class="locked">Blair,<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></span> and Sir Hugh Montgomerie)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
were treacherously seized, and hung up without
even the formality of a trial.</p>

<p>Wallace heard of the infamous proceeding, and
determined on severe retaliation. Selecting fifty
of his confederates, he hastened to the spot, and
being joined by a number of the retainers of the
murdered gentlemen, they surrounded the buildings
where the English were cantoned, and who, indulging
in fancied security arising from the terror which
they imagined the late severity was likely to impress
upon the Scots, had, after a deep carousal,
betaken themselves to rest, little dreaming of the
vengeance that awaited them.</p>

<p>Having procured the necessary combustibles,
Wallace, after disposing of his men, so as to prevent
the escape of any of the English, set fire to the
thatch, which being covered with pitch, the flames
soon spread to every part of the buildings, and rose
in one general conflagration; while the screaming
wretches within vainly attempting to escape, were
received on the points of the Scottish swords, and
either killed, or forced back, to perish in the devouring
element. It is said, that five hundred of the English
suffered in this lamentable manner. The severity
of the retaliation can only be palliated by the
nature of the war the parties were engaged in, and
the desperation to which the cruelty of the invaders
had goaded on the wretched inhabitants. If tradition
may be credited, Wallace did not remain till the
flames were extinguished; for, when about two
miles on his return, at an elevated part of the
road, he is said to have made his men look back
on the still blazing scene of their vengeance, remarking,
at the same time, that “The barns of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
Ayr burn weel.” The ruins of a church are still
to be seen on the spot where the chief and his followers
stood to take their last look, and which is
named from the circumstance, “<i>Burn weel Kirk</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<span class="subhead">WALLACE JOINED BY A NUMBER OF THE BARONS.&mdash;EXPEDITION
TO THE WEST HIGHLANDS&mdash;BATTLE OF BRADHER, AND DEATH
OF M’FADYAN.&mdash;AFFAIR OF GLASGOW.&mdash;DEFEAT AND FLIGHT
OF BISHOP BEK.</span></h2>

<p>A.D. 1297. About this time Sir William Douglas
took the Castles of Dresdier and Sanquhair, as already
stated in the short notice we have given of his
exploits. In conjunction with Wallace, this active
and powerful baron, assuming the sanction of the
name of Baliol, endeavoured to enforce the edict
for the expulsion of the English ecclesiastics holding
benefices in Scotland. This edict, issued between
the time of the taking of Berwick and the
Castle of Dunbar, had been rendered nugatory
by the suppression of Scottish independence. It
was now, however, executed with the utmost rigour,
wherever the influence of the insurgents extended.
In pursuance of this object, Wallace, at
the head of three hundred choice cavalry, proceeded
to Glasgow to dislodge Bishop Bek, who,
with a garrison of one thousand men, kept possession
of the town and episcopal castle, belonging
to Robert Wishart, the Scottish Bishop of
that place.</p>

<p>As the Scots drew near the spot against which
their operations were directed, Wallace divided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
his followers into two bands. Taking the command
of one himself, he committed the other to
the guidance of his uncle, the Laird of Auchinleck.
“<i>Whether</i>,” said our hero to his gallant
kinsman, “<i>do you choose to bear up the Bishop’s
tail, or go forward and take his blessing.</i>” Auchinleck
at once understood the intended plan of
attack, and proposed assailing the rear of the English,
resigning the more honourable post to the
merits of his nephew, “<i>who</i>,” as he jocularly
observed, “<i>had not yet been confirmed</i>.”</p>

<p>Having received the necessary instructions,
Wallace enjoined him to be diligent; “for,” said
he, “the men of Northumberland are all good
warriors.” The parties separated; that under Auchinleck
to make a compass round the town, so as
to get in rear of the enemy; and the other, under
the conduct of Wallace, advanced up the principal
street leading to the castle. Their approach,
however, had been discovered; for, when near the
present site of the college church, the Scots came
in contact with the English, and the inhabitants
had scarcely time to shelter themselves in their
houses, before a dreadful conflict commenced.
The powerful and warlike prelate with whom our
patriots had to contend, possessed a feudal following
of knights and esquires, inferior only to that
of Edward himself. The narrow street, however,
in which they were engaged was in favour of the
Scots; and the sword of Wallace told dreadfully
on the helmets and headpieces of the enemy. The
manner in which he swept his antagonists before
him, is still a matter of tradition among the
descendants of the early inhabitants of Glasgow.
Though the enemy fought with obstinacy, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
gallantry of the Scots sustained them against the
efforts of their numerous opponents; and in the
heat of the engagement, Wallace having unhorsed
Henry of Hornecester, a stout monk, who carried
the banner of the <span class="locked">Bishop,<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></span> this circumstance
damped the ardour of some of the superstitious
vassals of the prelate, who now fell back before a
vigorous charge of the Scots. At this juncture,
those under Auchinleck having reached the elevated
ground in the rear of the English, and seeing
the turmoil of battle that was raging below, hastily
arranged themselves for the charge, and, before the
enemy were fully apprised of their danger, the
torrent of spears came rushing down upon them
with overwhelming impetuosity. Their dismay
was now complete. A hasty and disordered retreat
ensued, and the by-ways leading from the
High-street were so choked up by the fugitives,
that a number of them were trampled to death by
their companions. <span class="locked">Bek<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></span> effected his escape, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
about three hundred horse, and directed his flight
towards England, carrying with him, it is supposed,
the sacred banner of St Cuthbert and that of St
John of <span class="locked">Beverly.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></span></p>

<p>While Wallace was thus employed in expelling
the English ecclesiastics from the west of Scotland,
Sir William Douglas was engaged in forwarding
the same object in the south. In these proceedings
they are charged by the English authors with
extreme cruelty. “The unhappy priests,” says
Knighton, “had their hands tied behind their backs,
and in this helpless state were thrown from high
bridges into rivers, their dying agonies affording
sport to their merciless captors.” Fordun merely
says, that Wallace pretended to execute the edict
of 1296, which appointed all English ecclesiastics
to be expelled from Scotland. On which Lord
Hailes remarks, “I hope this is not true; it has too
much the appearance of a political pretext, by
which defenceless individuals might be <span class="locked">persecuted.”<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></span>
There was little occasion for his
Lordship’s sympathy. The thirteenth century
was not the period when <i>churchmen</i> were the
objects of <i>causeless</i> persecutions. Their expulsion
appears to have been the result of their political
intrigues and criminal interference with the
records of the country intrusted to their charge.
And from their placing these documents in the
hands of Edward at Norham, he was enabled to
give a colouring of justice to his attempts upon
the independence of Scotland. The evidence
which these falsified muniments afforded is mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
by <span class="locked">Langtoft,<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></span> as being submitted by Edward
to the English barons for their advice before
the business of the submission respecting the Scottish
crown was entered upon. When the Scots
reflected on the many thousands of their nation, of
all ages, who had already been butchered at Berwick
and Dunbar,&mdash;the oppressions that had followed,&mdash;the
apparently interminable war entailed upon
them in support of the pretended proofs of the
supremacy of England; it is not to be wondered at,
that they should attempt to get rid of those canker-worms
who had nestled in their country, and ungratefully
betrayed its sacred and most invaluable
interests. The edict was early published, and
at a time when it could serve no other purpose
than a protest against the baseness of their conduct.
When the insurrection, therefore, broke out
under Wallace, it was not to be expected that individuals
who had rendered themselves so deservedly
obnoxious, would be treated with much lenity,
if they still attempted to retain their temporalities
at the expense of the people they had endeavoured
to <span class="locked">enslave.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></span></p>

<p>Wallace, uniting his forces with those under
Douglas, now made a rapid march upon Scone, expecting
to surprise Ormsby, the Justiciary of Edward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
who was holding his courts in that place. The
attempt was all but completely successful. They
came unexpectedly on the enemy, a great many
of whom were either killed or taken prisoners,
and a rich booty fell into the hands of the Scots.
Ormsby narrowly escaped; and, impressed with
terror at the late dreadful acts of retaliation, fled
with precipitation to England. Encouraged by
these successes, a number of the aristocracy joined
the banner of our hero, among whom were the
Steward of Scotland, his brother the Knight of
Bonkill, Alexander de Lindsay, Sir John Stewart
of Rusky (or Menteith), Sir Richard Lundin, and
Robert Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow, whom he had
so lately relieved from the obnoxious interference
of the Bishop of Durham. In consequence of this
timely assistance, Wallace was enabled to undertake
an enterprise of considerable importance.</p>

<p>The reader will perceive, by the annexed <span class="locked">note,<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
that though Edward had made a triumphal march
with his army from Berwick to Elgin; yet that interesting
and extensive portion of Scotland, comprising
the West Highlands and Islands, had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
been profaned by the foot of the usurper. This
may have been partly averted, by most of the chieftains
coming forward and taking the oath of allegiance,
and partly by the extreme difficulty of leading
a numerous army through a country so intersected
by arms of the sea, and rendered almost
inaccessible by its rocky and mountainous barriers.
In order to have some control over a people so
isolated, the policy of Edward at first suggested
the idea of carrying along with him those chieftains
whose influence was considered the most extensive.
This measure, however, he soon perceived was not
so effectual as he anticipated, and he accordingly
determined on sending a colony of Irish to fix
themselves in some central part of the country
he wished to overawe. With this view he compelled
MacDougal of Lorn, whom he had carried
with him to London, to exchange his patrimony for
an equivalent of lands belonging to himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
Having effected this, he gave a <span class="locked">grant,<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></span> of no
very certain limits, to a creature of his own named
M’Fadyan, who, with a tumultuous horde of Anglo-Irish
and renegade Scots, amounting to about
fifteen thousand, landed in Lorn, and proceeded
to ravage the country with fire and sword,&mdash;committing
the most revolting atrocities on such of the
inhabitants as refused to join them. Much obscurity
hangs over the birth, connections, and character
of the leader of this cloud of locusts. According
to Blind Harry, his origin was low, although
high in favour at the English court. He
seems to have held some situation of importance
in Ireland, as the Minstrel, referring to those Irish
refugees who took shelter in Scotland under Wallace,
says,</p>

<p class="in0">Having talents and ambition he allied himself to
the enemies of his country, and, like other mushrooms,
throve amid the rankness of that corruption
with which he had surrounded himself. A wretch
that had risen by oppressing and assisting to bind
the necks of his free-born countrymen to the yoke
of slavery, was a very fit instrument to employ
in forwarding the views of Edward in the subjugation
of Scotland.</p>

<p>He had not, however, proceeded far before the
<i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">Crann-tàir</i>, or fiery cross, was seen hurrying on, by
hill and glen, to gather the children of the Gaël to
repel their savage assailants. Duncan of Lorn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
the uncle, or, according to some, the younger
brother of the chief, unable to withstand the superior
force of the enemy, had retreated towards
Loch-Awe, to obtain the protection of Sir Niel
Campbell. This brave man, along with his brother
<i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">Donnchadh dubh nan Caisteal</i>, (Black
Duncan of the Castles), had collected a body
of three hundred <i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">Gall-oglaich</i> (well armed warriors)
part of whom were the vassals of Malcolm
MacGregor of <span class="locked">Glenurchy.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></span> With this force
he continued to embarrass the enemy, by attacking
their foraging parties and cutting off their supplies.
This determined MacFadyan to follow him
through the fastnesses of the country, and endeavour
to overwhelm him by his superior numbers.
Sir Niel managed his retreat with great dexterity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
After leading his unwary adversary round by the
head of Bradher Pass, he hurried down that dangerous
and difficult defile, and, crossing the narrow
and ill constructed fabric which served for a bridge,
he broke it down; and thus being secure from
immediate pursuit, found himself in one of the
strongest positions imaginable. His front was defended
by a castle, which commanded the only approach
by which he could be assailed; while his rear
was protected by the Awe, a deep and rapid river,
running out of a loch of the same name. The almost
perpendicular barrier of rocks which lined the
side of the Awe&mdash;down which, as has already been
mentioned, Sir Niel and his party had to make
their way, before they could place the river between
them and their pursuers&mdash;was of such a nature,
that a man could not get on without the
assistance of his hands, to prevent him from
slipping down into the deep and eddying abyss
below; and even with this assistance, at the present
day, it is a passage of considerable danger,
from the enormous masses of loose stones with
which the sloping face of the rocks is covered,
from the brink of the water to their summits,
which are of great elevation. The least accidental
derangement of the stones at the bottom, never
fails to put those above in motion, when an immense
rush takes place, attended often with serious
consequences to the parties underneath. The
reader may readily conceive the facility, therefore,
with which, thus circumstanced, Sir Niel and his
followers could, from the opposite side of the river,
retard the advance of even a larger army than that
of M’Fadyan. The difficulty of the pass is not
perceptible till the angle of the rock is fairly turned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
consequently the Irish army had no opportunity
of covering their advance by discharging their missiles.
They were obliged to follow each other singly;
thus affording, as they came creeping along, fair
marks for the arrows of the Scots, part of whom
plied their deadly shafts, while others were engaged
in throwing stones from their slings against the
face of the rocks, and thus bringing down masses
of the loose fragments upon the heads of their
already embarrassed pursuers.</p>

<p>The castle to which Sir Niel retired, though
small, possessed great natural advantages. Situated
on a rocky knoll at the edge of a deep ravine, it
could only be approached from the road through
which M’Fadyan had to advance, and that by
means of a ladder which the party within always
kept on their own side. When they wished to
admit any one, a rope was thrown over that he
might pull the ladder towards him; he then descended
to the bottom of the ravine, when, placing
the ladder against the opposite rock, in this manner
he ascended and reached the <span class="locked">castle.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></span></p>

<p>When Sir Niel Campbell had determined on his
line of retreat, he despatched Duncan of Lorn, and
an old, but swift-footed Highlander, named Michael<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
or Gillemichel, to acquaint Wallace of his perilous
situation, and to crave his aid in driving the invaders
from the country. Wallace, aware of the importance
of preventing the establishment intended
by Edward, lost no time in complying with the request
of his old confederate; and Sir Richard Lundin
having joined him with five hundred men, he
now found himself enabled to march to the relief
of the West Highlanders, at the head of two thousand
soldiers.</p>

<p>In Duncan of Lorn and his servant, Wallace
had sure and intelligent guides. At that time nothing
but intricate footpaths, known only to the
natives, existed in the Highlands; and as they were
often formed by deer-stalkers, while tracing their
game, they frequently led through places both
perilous and perplexing to the stranger.</p>

<p>By the time the Scottish army had reached the
Chapel of St Phillan, part of the foot soldiers began
to flag, and get disordered in their ranks. Wallace,
therefore, stopped, and thus addressed them. “Good
men,” said he, “this will never do. If we come up
with the enemy in such broken array, we may receive
serious injury ourselves, but can do them very
little hurt in return. It is also necessary that we
should be up with them as soon as possible; for if they
hear of our approach, they may choose a plain field,
where their numbers will give them advantage. To
prevent this, I will go forward with those who are
able, and leave the rest to follow at more leisure.”
Accordingly, taking with himself two hundred of the
tried veterans of Ayrshire, and placing another hundred
under the command of Sir John Graham, with
Sir Richard Lundin at the head of his own followers,
they crossed a mountain in their front, and descended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
into Glendouchar. Here they met a scout, whom
they had previously sent forward, acting as guide
to Sir Niel Campbell and his three hundred Highlanders.
This wary leader, on hearing of the advance
of Wallace, thought it proper to retire towards
him, and leave the passage free to M’Fadyan,
who, he knew, if he followed, could make
choice of very few positions where his numbers
would be of any advantage. Having given our
hero a detail of what information he possessed respecting
the state of the invaders, Gillemichel was
again sent forward to watch the motions of the
enemy; and the tough old mountaineer having fallen
in with a scout from M’Fadyan, who had been sent
to tract the route of Sir Niel, managed to despatch
him with his <i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">claidh mòr</i>, and returned with the intelligence
to his chief.</p>

<p>The ground having now become impassable for
cavalry, the Scots dismounted, and proceeded on
foot. Their march had not been perceived by the
enemy, and, from the superior knowledge they had
of the country, they managed to surprise the Irish
in a situation where flight was almost impracticable,
and the superiority of their numbers became
rather a disadvantage. The conflict continued
for two hours, with unexampled fury on both
sides. Multitudes of the Irish were forced over the
rocks into the gulf below. Many threw themselves
into the water to escape the swords of the Scots;
while various bands of Highlanders, stationed among
the rocks, sent down showers of stones and arrows
where the enemy appeared most obstinate in
the strife. Wallace, armed with a steel mace, at
the head of his veterans, now made a charge, which
decided the fate of the day. Those Scots who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
joined the Irish, threw away their arms, and on
their knees implored mercy. M’Fadyan, with
fifteen of his men, having made his way over
the rocks, and attempted to conceal himself in
a cave “wndyr cragmòr,” Duncan of Lorn requested
permission of Wallace to follow and punish
him for the atrocities he had committed; and it
was not long before he returned, bringing his head
on a spear, which Sir Niel Campbell caused to be
fixed on the top of the rock in which he had taken
shelter.</p>

<p>After the defeat of M’Fadyan, Wallace held a
meeting of the chiefs of the West Highlands, in
the priory of Ardchattan; and having arranged
some important matters respecting the future defence
of the district, he returned to his duties in
the Low Country, having received an accession to
his numbers, which covered any loss he had sustained
in the late engagement. The spoil which
the Scots collected after the battle is said to have
been very considerable; any personal share in
which, our hero, as usual, <span class="locked">refused.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></span></p>

AND CLIFFORD SENT TO SUPPRESS THE INSURRECTION.&mdash;NIGHT
SKIRMISH IN ANNANDALE.&mdash;DISAFFECTION OF THE SCOTTISH
NOBLES.&mdash;WALLACE RETIRES TO THE NORTH.&mdash;BATTLE OF
STIRLING BRIDGE.</span></h2>

<p>The success of the insurrection excited by Wallace,
has been attributed by some English authors&mdash;and
by <span class="locked">Langtoft<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></span> in particular&mdash;to the foolish
parsimony of Cressingham, who had disgusted the
English soldiery by withholding their pay, at a
time when their services might have been of the
greatest advantage. In consequence of this unjust
procedure, many of the yeomen and pages, finding
little else than danger to be met with in the service,
deserted their posts, and returned to their own
country. Although the impolitic and avaricious
character of the English treasurer is a matter on
which the authors of both countries are agreed,
the precipitation with which the garrisons of the
Usurper now retreated on the approach of the
Scots, shows that the severe examples which had
already been made were not without their effect.</p>

<p>While our hero was thus following up his plan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
for the emancipation of his country, his standard
was unexpectedly joined by the younger Robert
Bruce. This powerful baron, it seems, had incurred
the suspicion of the Warden of the Western
Marches, who summoned him to attend at Carlisle,
on pretence of business relating to the kingdom.
Afraid to disobey, Bruce made his appearance, accompanied
by a numerous retinue of his followers,
and was there obliged to make oath on the consecrated
host, and the sword of Thomas à Becket,
that he would remain the faithful vassal of the
King of England. In order to prove his loyalty,
and do away with the mistrust attached to him,
he made an inroad on the estates of Sir William
Douglas, who at the time was acting with Wallace,
and carried off his wife and children to one of his
own fortresses in Annandale. Having thus lulled
the suspicions that had been awakened, he next assembled
his father’s vassals, and endeavoured to
persuade them to join him in attempting the deliverance
of their country. In this, however, he
was disappointed: he therefore collected his own
retainers, and marched to the quarters of Wallace;
consoling himself with the reflection, that the
Pope would easily absolve him from his extorted
oath.</p>

<p>The insurrection in Scotland had hitherto been
regarded by Edward more as the unconnected
operations of banditti, than any thing like an organized
scheme for regaining the national independence.
Having most of the Scottish barons in his
power from whom he thought he had any thing
to apprehend, and conceiving that their vassals
would not dare to move without the warrant of
their superior,&mdash;he looked upon the affair as one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
which the troops he had left behind were more than
sufficient to suppress. In this opinion he was confirmed
both by the English and the Scotch barons
whom he had along with him. The latter, either ignorant,
or pretending ignorance of the talents and
resources of our hero, represented their presence
as being absolutely necessary before any formidable
force could be brought into the field; and <span class="locked">Langtoft<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></span>
charges the English barons with deceiving
their sovereign in the affair, and concealing from
him the real state of the country. It is a matter
of notoriety, that about this time, Edward and his
nobles were not on the best of terms. Having
now, as he thought, in addition to Wales, insured
the subjection and obedience of Scotland, and remembering
the facility with which, by the aid of
30,000 Scots lent him by Alexander III., he overawed
and suppressed the Earl of Gloucester and
those who took part with him; he began to assume
towards the English nobility an imperious
and haughty demeanour, which both alarmed their
fears and excited their jealousy. The unprincipled
stretches of power which he had attempted since
his triumphal entry into London after his victories
in Scotland, had also sown the seeds of dissatisfaction
among the inferior classes, who, no longer
dazzled with the splendour of his achievements over
the freedom of their neighbours, began to reflect
on the encroachments which their ambitious sovereign
was making on their own.</p>

<p>When Edward, therefore, became fully apprised
of the serious nature of the revolt in Scotland, he
paused in the midst of preparations for an expedition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
to Flanders, and despatched orders to the Earl of
Surrey for the suppression and punishment of the
insurgents. This distinguished and powerful nobleman,
the most efficient perhaps of all Edward’s
generals, was at that time residing in Northumberland
for the recovery of his health. Having associated
with him in the command, his nephew Lord
Henry Percy, and Robert de Clifford, he sent them
forward with forty thousand foot and three hundred
cavalry, a force which he deemed sufficient
to restore the country to the allegiance of his
<span class="locked">master.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></span></p>

<p>While the troops under Percy and Clifford were
on their march through Annandale, their camp
was attacked during the night by a body of
Scots, led on by Wallace and Douglas. The darkness
prevented the English from at first discovering
the numbers of their assailants. Much
confusion in consequence ensued; and many
were either killed or driven into the adjacent
morass. In this extremity, the English set fire
to a number of their own tents; and, by the
light thus obtained, they were enabled to form
their ranks, and repulse the enemy, who were too
inconsiderable in number to attempt any thing beyond
a surprise. Hence, it may be inferred, that
Bruce and his Annandale vassals were not engaged
in the affair.</p>

<p>The English army lost no time in following the
tract of the Scots, who retired towards those districts
where the cause of national liberty had gained
the greatest ascendancy. On reaching the
neighbourhood of Irvine, the English commander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
found Wallace and the insurgent barons encamped
on a well chosen position, and able, from their
numbers, to have given battle, had they not been
wofully enfeebled by dissension. The feuds among
them ran so high, that Sir Richard Lundin, whose
services had lately proved so useful, went over in
disgust to the enemy, declaring that “he would
no longer remain with a party at variance with itself.”
His example was speedily followed by others,
most of whom, as they were the cause of
the dissension, could not assign the same reason
for their conduct. Pride of birth, and reluctance on
the part of the higher barons to submit to the only
man among them who had <span class="locked">talents<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></span> to meet the
emergency, have been assigned, with great probability,
as the cause of this unfortunate disagreement.
The Steward of Scotland; his brother, the Knight
of Bonkill; Robert Bruce; William Douglas; Alexander
de Lindsay; and Wishart, Bishop of
Glasgow, with their followers, were among those
who submitted to the enemy. The Bishop negociated
the terms on which they were to be admitted
to the peace of their “Lord Paramount:”&mdash;an
acknowledgment of their errors, and hostages for
their future obedience, were the basis of the treaty;
and a copy of the deed, to which their seals were
appended, was sent to Wallace, in expectation of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
following their example. The high-minded patriot,
however, entertaining views of a more elevated
nature, treated this record of their desertion
of the liberties of their country with merited
disdain.</p>

<p>At the head of his personal adherents, and a
large body of the “<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">liberi firmarii</i>,” or free yeomanry
of Scotland, Wallace retired indignantly
towards the North. This latter class of men consisted
of the tenants, and descendants of tenants,
of the crown and church-lands, or those who occupied
farms on the demesnes of the barons, for
which they paid an equivalent rent in money
or produce. They had the privilege of removing
to whatever place they might think
most desirable, and owed no military service except
to the King for the defence of the country.
Among them the independence of Scotland always
found its most faithful and stubborn supporters.
These “liberi firmarii,” for so they are
called in the chartularies, and chamberlains’ accounts,
were considered so useful from their superior
industry, and agricultural knowledge, that
during the minority of the Maid of Norway, a sum
of money appears to have been distributed among
them as an inducement to remain on the crown lands
of Libertoun and Lawrence-town, which they were
preparing to leave in consequence of a mortality
among their cattle. They formed a striking contrast
to the <i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">cottars</i> or <i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">villeyns</i>, who were entirely
subject, both in body and means, to the will of the
landholder, and were sold or transferred along
with the estate; and could be claimed or brought
back to it, if they removed, in the same manner as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
strayed <span class="locked">cattle.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></span> These formed the bulk of the
degraded horde who followed the banners of the
recreant barons, and whose servility, ignorance
and ferocity, often made them dangerous to the
liberties of the country; while the former class,
along with the freemen of the boroughs, supplied
the materials from which Wallace recruited the
ranks of his patriotic battalions.</p>

<p>Aware, from former experience, of the difficulty
of bringing Wallace to action if he were not so inclined,
Percy and Clifford appear to have withdrawn
their forces, satisfied with having detached
the aristocracy from his standard; none remaining
with our hero save the gallant Sir Andrew Murray,
Sir John Graham, and a few of his own personal
friends.</p>

<p>But the system which Wallace had organised for
the emancipation of his country, was not liable to
any material derangement, in consequence of the
defection of a few timid and interested barons.
It is true, the desertion of such men as Sir William
Douglas must have occasioned him considerable
regret, being thereby prevented from meeting
the enemy openly in the field, with such an
equality of force as would have insured success.
This feeling, however, did not retard his exertions,
but rather stimulated him to fresh undertakings;
for we find that he shortly afterwards surprised and
garrisoned the Castle of Dunotter. <span class="locked">Tyber,<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></span> or Tibber,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
on the banks of the Nith, he also took and destroyed.
Forfar, Brechin and Montrose, were
either taken, or deserted by their garrisons on his
approach. Aberdeen, which the enemy set on fire,
and then retreated to their ships, afterwards fell into
his hands. He then led his troops against the
Castle of Dundee, and had already made considerable
progress in the siege of that strong-hold,
when he was apprised of the advance of an English
army under the Earl of Warren, and Cressingham
the treasurer.</p>

<p>Edward, dissatisfied with the imperfect measures
which had been taken for the suppression of
the Scottish revolt, and irritated by the accounts
which were daily received of the operations of the
insurgents, had despatched peremptory orders for
Warren to proceed in person to the North. He
also directed his writs to the Bishop and Sheriff of
Aberdeenshire, commanding them to adopt strong
and effectual means for extinguishing the flame of
rebellion within the boundaries of their jurisdiction.
They were likewise required to furnish whatever
supplies might be wanted by William de <span class="locked">Warren<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></span>
for the defence of the Castle of Urquhart, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
strong and extensive fortress on the banks of Loch
Ness, of which he was governor. Warren was
also ordered to be at his post, and fully prepared
to meet any attempt of the enemy.</p>

<p>On learning the movements of the English,
Wallace collected those of the burgesses of Dundee
who were able to bear arms, and, placing them
under the command of their townsman, Sir Alexander
Scrymgeour, enjoined them, at the peril of
“lyf and <span class="locked">lyme,”<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></span> to continue the siege. He
then retired, with his followers, who were now
considerably increased, to watch the motions of
the advancing army.</p>

<p>In cases of invasion, a favourite plan adopted
by the Scots for the defence of their country, was
to convey their cattle and other valuables to the
more inaccessible districts north of the Forth. By
this measure, they not only secured their own suppplies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
but, by depriving their enemies of the means
of subsistence, compelled them to an early retreat
as the only resource against the miseries of starvation.
On the present occasion the usual precaution
was not <span class="locked">omitted.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></span></p>

<p>The success which had attended our hero, since
the affair of Irvine, and the formidable character
of the well-disciplined force which now adhered
to his banner, occasioned a wavering among a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
number of those barons who had so shamefully
submitted to the usurper. Their situation, it must
be allowed, had become one of great difficulty.
The character of Wallace was stern and decisive.
The punishment he inflicted on such offenders,
they had reason to know was seldom mitigated
by any consideration for the high rank of the <span class="locked">parties;<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></span>
and the English had repeatedly shown,
that they were unable to protect the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">serviles</i> from
the vengeance of their indignant countrymen. It
was therefore with no slight alarm that the party
heard of the house of the Bishop of Glasgow being
attacked, and pillaged, and his family carried
off they knew not whither. The selection which
Wallace had made of Wishart, as an example to
the others, had no doubt been suggested partly by
the ingratitude of that churchman, in deserting
the cause, after having been, by means of the patriots,
so lately restored to his diocese; and partly
from his being so instrumental in the disgraceful
negociation with the enemy. The sacredness
attached to his character, as a priest, would
speedily disappear before the heinous offence of
assisting to detach, in the hour of need, the swords
of a Douglas, a Lundin, and a Bruce, from the
service of their country. Meanwhile the hostages
for their fidelity had been carelessly exacted;
and when soon after called for by Warren, (whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
remiss conduct had so far incurred the displeasure
of Edward, that he sent Brian Fitz Alan to supersede
him as lieutenant), he found them more
inclined for a new arrangement, than willing to
fulfil the terms of the former. They wished, in
particular, to introduce some stipulations respecting
the liberty of Scotland, a proposal no doubt
made for the purpose of allaying in some degree
the indignation of their patriotic countrymen.
The continued obstinacy, and increasing
power of Wallace, was made a pretext for their
non-compliance; and they could now with apparent
justice decline the final ratification of a
deed of treason against the independence of their
country, when protection from the consequences
was so extremely uncertain.</p>

<p>In this dilemma the Steward and the Earl of
Lennox sought permission of Warren to open a
communication with the leader of the Scots, under
pretext of bringing him over to the interests of
Edward. In consequence of this arrangement, these
chiefs ventured to visit the Scottish army, which, by
this time, had reached the neighbourhood of Stirling,
and taken up a strong position near the
bridge, where it appeared determined to wait the
approach of the English. The retiring population
had left little behind them that could be
useful to the enemy; all their cattle and provisions
being now secured in the rear of the protecting
columns of their countrymen. This rendered the
position of Wallace still more valuable, prepared,
as he was, in the event of a defeat, to fall back to
certain supplies, while his opponents would be still
farther removed from their resources.</p>

<p>But if feuds had rendered the Scots inert and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
submissive to the enemy at Irvine, the councils of
the English were now, in their turn, distracted
from the same cause. The mind of Warren appeared
more occupied in brooding over his late
disgrace, than in attending to the details of the
campaign; while <span class="locked">Cressingham,<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></span> a haughty, ambitious,
and imperious churchman, assumed additional
importance on learning that his colleague
had incurred the royal displeasure. Conflicting
measures, supported by querulous and acrimonious
language, engendered a dangerous spirit of animosity
between them. Cressingham, on the plea
of economy, ordered the disbanding of a body of
eight thousand foot and three hundred cavalry,
commanded by Lord Henry Percy, a force which
Warren wished to retain as a reserve; and during
the altercations which this occasioned, the communications
of the Steward and the Earl of Lennox
with the Scottish camp were injudiciously allowed
to continue.</p>

<p>On the arrival, however, of the English in front
of the position occupied by the Scots, those noblemen
returned. With well feigned displeasure
they announced their inability to make any pacific
impression on Wallace and his followers; and then
took their leave, for the alleged purpose of bringing
up a number of their mounted vassals to join
the English, who were to defile along the bridge
in the morning.</p>

<p>Five thousand foot and a body of Welsh archers
had passed the bridge before Warren had left
his <span class="locked">bed.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></span> Whether this sluggishness on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
part of the English general arose from indisposition
or chagrin, is not explicitly stated. The troops,
however, on finding that they were not supported
by the rest of the army, returned to their station.
Warren, who arose about an hour after,&mdash;feeling,
perhaps, reluctant to attack the Scots in their
present position, and not deeming it prudent to
calculate on the recurrence of the same mistake
which had given him so easy a victory at Dunbar,&mdash;despatched
two friars to make a last attempt at
pacification.</p>

<p>The answer returned was evidently intended to
exasperate the English, and bring them on headlong
to the fray. After a bold declaration of independence,
a taunting allusion was made to the
conquerors of England. “We came not here,”
said the intrepid assertor of Scotland’s rights, “to
negociate, but to fight; and were even your masters
to come and attack us, we are ready to meet
them at our swords’ point, and show them that
our country is free.” Enraged at this stern and
provoking defiance, the English became clamorous
to be led on.</p>

<p>A council of war being called, it was proposed
by Cressingham that the army should instantly
cross the river and attack the Scots. In this he
was opposed by Sir Richard Lundin, who pointed
out the many difficulties they would have to encounter
in attempting to defile along a bridge, so
narrow, in presence of so wary an enemy; and offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
to guide them to a ford not far distant, where
they could pass with less hazard. Cressingham,&mdash;either
displeased at being contradicted,&mdash;or not
placing full reliance on the fidelity of Lundin,
who had but recently joined the English, told Warren,&mdash;who
appeared to hesitate, that, as treasurer
of the King of England, he (Cressingham) could
not be answerable for squandering the money of his
master in protracted warfare with a handful of
enemies, who,&mdash;in order to be defeated, had only
to be attacked, and would always be formidable,&mdash;provided
they were never brought to an engagement.
Stung by the reproach conveyed in these
remarks, Warren gave orders for the troops to move
onwards.</p>

<p>Sir Marmaduke Twenge, a knight belonging to
the North-Riding of Yorkshire, of much experience
and distinguished personal prowess, assisted
Cressingham in leading the van. When nearly
one half of the English had cleared the bridge
without opposition, an attempt was made to dislodge
the Scots from the ground they had chosen;
and for that purpose, Sir Marmaduke rather impatiently
charged up-hill with a body of heavy-armed
cavalry. The consequence was, however,
fatal to the assailants, as the enemy, from their
vantage-ground, drove them headlong before them
with their long spears. In the mean time, the
communication between the bridge and the van of
the English army was cut off by a masterly movement
of a division of the Scots, who afterwards
kept up such an incessant discharge of arrows,
<span class="locked">darts,<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></span> “gavelocks,” and other missiles, as completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
interrupted the progress of the enemy.
Wallace contemplated, for a moment, the success
of his plan, and instantly rushed down to the
attack with an impetuosity which the scarcely
formed battalions of the English were ill prepared
to withstand. Giving way to the shock, they fell
into irretrievable confusion, while the repeated
charges of the compact bodies of the Scottish
spearmen were fast covering the ground with the
splendid wreck of the chivalry of England. The
scene now became animating beyond measure; and
many of those who had defended the bridge forsook
their companions to join in the desperate
<i>mêleé</i>. The passage being thus left comparatively
open, the royal standard of England, displaying
“<i>Three gold leopards courant, set on red</i>,” was advanced
to the cry of&mdash;“For God and St George!”
attended by a strong body of knights, who, with
their triangular shields, defending themselves
from the missiles which still showered thick upon
the bridge, rushed forward to aid their fellow-combatants.
The banner of Warren next appeared,
<i>chequered with gold and azure</i>, and followed by
his numerous vassals. The day, however, was too
far gone to be retrieved, even by this powerful assistance.
Finding no room to form, they only increased
the confusion, and swelled the slaughter
made by the Scottish spearmen, before whose
steady and overwhelming charges thousands were
either borne down or driven into the river.</p>

<p>While Warren, with inexpressible anxiety, beheld
from the opposite bank the destruction of the
flower of his army, the Steward of Scotland and
the Earl of Lennox were seen approaching with a
strong body of horse; but, as might be expected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
instead of joining the English, they assisted their
countrymen in pursuing and killing those who
were attempting to save themselves. Sir Marmaduke
Twenge gallantly cut his way to the bridge,
and <span class="locked">escaped.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></span></p>

<p>The panic now became general, and the face of
the country was soon covered with a confused mass
of terrified fugitives, hurrying on to avoid the
swords of their conquerors, and increasing, as they
fled, the disorder of their retreat, by throwing away
their arms and their standards, in order to facilitate
their flight.</p>

<p>Wallace having crossed the ford alluded to
by Lundin, the pursuit was followed up with the
most destructive perseverance. The day of retribution
had arrived;&mdash;the butcheries of Berwick, the
carnage of Dunbar, with a long list of national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
indignities and personal sufferings had now to be
atoned for. Conscious of the provocation which
had roused to frenzy the vengeance of an infuriated
people, Warren turned with dismay from the scene
of havoc, leaving twenty thousand of his soldiers
to manure the fields of those they had so lately
oppressed. Cressingham, the most detested of
all the tools of Edward, was among the number of
the slain;&mdash;and when Wallace came up, a party
were employed in flaying the body. According to
the MS. Chronicle of Lanercost, he is said to have
ordered only as much of the skin to be taken off
as would make a sword-belt; and his men, perhaps,
imitating his example, might have appropriated the
rest. This, says a respectable <span class="locked">author,<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></span> is no doubt
the origin of the tale told by Abercromby and some
other historians, of the Scots having used it as
girths to their horses. An order of this kind,
given in the heat of the pursuit, was perhaps never
thought of afterwards; at least, we have no account
of Wallace ever wearing such an appendage.
The circumstance, however, shows the deep-rooted
detestation with which the individual was regarded.</p>

<p>Warren, who fled rapidly to Berwick, was most
probably, like another English general of more
modern times, the first herald of his own discomfiture.
The consternation which his disaster occasioned
among his countrymen in Scotland was
so great, that few or none would venture to wait
the approach of the enemy; but, abandoning their
strongholds, they hurried southward with the
greatest precipitation, justly conceiving that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
terms they were likely to obtain from one who followed
up his victories with so much energy, were
hardly worth staying for. The loss on the part of
the Scots was comparatively small; none of note
having fallen, save the brave Sir Andrew Murray
of <span class="locked">Bothwell.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></span></p>

<p>In this manner was Scotland once more restored
to that liberty of which she had been so unjustly
deprived. Nor was the benefit conferred on the
country less, than the glory which redounded to
her gallant liberator. The brilliant and decisive
victory at Stirling Bridge was gained on the 11th
September 1297, exactly twelve months and eleven
days from the return of Edward to Berwick, after
what he conceived to be the final subjugation of
the kingdom.</p>

<p>The state of Scotland in the early part of 1297,
was such as might well have extinguished the ardour
of any mind possessed of less energy than
that of Wallace. He saw his country humbled
and debased at the feet of a tyrant, whose talents
and power forbade every hope of emancipation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
while the boldest of her nobles dared not express
a wish to be free. His own indignant feelings
blazed forth, and, with his kindling enthusiasm,
he breathed into his torpid and enslaved countrymen,
the breath as it were of a new existence.
The regenerating influence of his heroic example,
was quickly caught by those whose bosoms still
beat responsive to the call of honour; and in the
short space we have mentioned, those banners
which had lately waved over hecatombs of butchered
Scots, and had been paraded through the land
with all the triumphant arrogance of conquest, were
now trampled under foot, and the colossal power
by which they were sustained, overthrown before
the virtuous indignation of a people determined to
be free. When we contemplate the might and
the resources of Edward, who, in addition to those
of his own kingdom, had Ireland, Wales, and his
Continental possessions to depend upon; it is impossible
not to feel impressed with admiration at
the greatness of that mind, which, with the fractions
of a divided and dispirited people, could
form the idea of braving a force so overwhelming:
But when we find those plans which he had conceived
in the deep recesses of his woodland retreats,
not only perseveringly carried on against a
tide of adverse circumstances&mdash;in defiance of the
aristocracy of his own country, and the opposition
of secret and avowed enemies&mdash;it may with
truth be said, that, however highly he may have
been extolled, a tythe of his greatness has not yet
been appreciated. Much has been said of romance
being mixed up with the accounts given of him;
but it would be difficult for any of those who delight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
in <i>nibbling</i> at great names, to point out any
tradition respecting Wallace, sufficiently romantic
to outstrip the simple facts that stand recorded of
him in the authentic annals of British history.</p>

<p>Deserted by the barons at a time when he conceived
he had united in the sacred cause all that
was noble, and all that was high minded in the
land, it required no common intrepidity to bear up
against their heartless and unseemly defection;
and to recruit his ranks after so serious a diminution,
required talents of the highest order,
and exertions beyond the reach of ordinary men.
This, however, he not only accomplished, but also
recovered a number of fortresses,&mdash;drove the enemy
from the North, and, with a numerous and
gallant army, sat down in a well-chosen position,
to await the advance of the legions of England,&mdash;all
within two months of the disgraceful negociation
at Irvine.</p>

<p>After a victory achieved in the face of difficulties
so formidable; with what feelings must the
hero of Stirling Bridge and the Scottish aristocracy
have regarded each other! The mighty force of
him whom they had acknowledged as their Lord
Paramount, was now broken and dispersed before
the superior valour and steadiness of one whom
they had so rashly abandoned. In the rich harvest
of laurels which had been acquired, they had
excluded themselves from all participation; and,
though conscious that they could not lay claim
to a single leaf, they were sensible that the heroism
of their late companions would soon be emblazoned
through every country in Europe; while
they had the mortification to reflect, that the tale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
of their own pusillanimous submission, would be
held up as a counterpart to the gallantry of those
friends whom they had so shamefully forsaken in
the road to immortality.</p>

<span class="subhead"><a href="#Page_179">Page 179.</a></span></h2>

<p>The following memoranda respecting this celebrated
tree, will doubtless be acceptable to the
<span class="locked">reader:<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></span></p>

<p>“In Dunipace parish is the famous Torwood,
in the middle of which there are the remains of
Wallace’s Tree, an oak, which, according to a
measurement when entire, was said to be about 12
feet diameter. To this wood Wallace is said to
have fled, and secreted himself in the body of that
tree, then hollow, after his defeat in the north.”&mdash;<i>Stat.
Acc.</i> iii. 336.</p>

<p>“This oak is still dignified by the name of <i>Wallace’s
Tree</i>. It stands in the middle of a swampy
moss, having a causeway round its ruins; and its
destruction has been much precipitated, by the veneration
in which the Scottish hero has been long
held; numerous pieces have been carried off, to be
converted into various memorials of the Champion
of Scotland.”&mdash;<i>Kerr’s Hist. of Bruce</i>, i. 127.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
“Wallace’s Oak, as it has been called for ages,
still remains in the Torwood near Stirling. The
old tradition of the country bears, that Sir William
Wallace, after a lost battle, secreted himself
in this tree, and escaped the pursuit of his enemies.
By this account, it behoved then, that is, about
500 years ago, to have been a large tree. Whatever
may be its age, it certainly has in its ruins the
appearance of greater antiquity than what I have
observed in any tree in Scotland.</p>

<p>“At a very remote period it has separated in
the middle, and the one half of it has mouldered entirely
away. The other half remains, and is in one
place about twenty feet high. But what the tree
was above this height, is unknown. All the original
part of the tree is putrid. Yet one may perceive
that the whole of it, from the head to the
very bark, has been red wood, and is so hard
even in its putrid state as to admit of a polish.</p>

<p>“In this ancient Torwood, it stands in a manner
alone. For there are no trees, nor any ruin of
a tree, to be seen that is nearly coeval. Compared
to it, even the oldest of them is of a very modern
date. The memory of its having saved Wallace,
has probably been the means of its preservation,
when all the rest of the wood at different
times has been destroyed. It has been immemorially
held in veneration, and is still viewed in that
light.</p>

<p>“There is a peculiar sort of renovation of an
old tree that sometimes occurs, and has taken
place in this. A young bark has shot upwards
from the root in several places, which has formed
fresh branches towards the top of the old trunk.
This young bark has spread, and still spreads, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
a callus, over several parts of the old tree that are
dead; and particularly over a very large arm,
which has had no bark on it in the remembrance
of the oldest person alive.</p>

<p>“The tree stands in carse land, in a deep wet
clay-soil. The road that passes by it in the wood
is laid crossways with thick branches of trees, to
prevent carriages from sinking to the axles in wet
weather.”&mdash;<i>Essays on Natural History, by John
Walker, D.D.</i> (1771.)</p>

<p>The ground on which this tree stood was elevated
above the surrounding level, which appears
at one time to have been a sort of swamp. Causeways
of a rude construction led up to the oak on
different directions; and as the first formation of
these causeways is beyond the memory of the oldest
inhabitants living, it proves that the sheltering
place of the Defender of Scotland must have been
an object of deep interest to his countrymen at a
very early period. Although this ancient memorial
of Wallace measured, in the recollection of
people still living, 42 feet in circumference, not a
vestige of it is now to be discovered. The veneration
with which it was regarded, secured it from
all human interference; and it was left to the winds
of heaven, and the hand of time, till it reached
that state of decay which indicated an approaching
crisis. Its extinction was then hastened by
an anxiety on the part of visitors to possess some
portion of it, as a relict of one with whose name
it had been so long associated; and so far was
this feeling carried, that, after the trunk had disappeared,
the ground was dug up to the extent of
twelve feet round it, in order to get at any fragment
of the root that might chance to remain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
This grand search took place after the time
was fixed for the visit of George IV. to Scotland;
and Mr Craig, an artist residing at Helensburgh,
of considerable taste in his profession,
used a part of it which had then been found, in the
formation of a snuff-box, ingeniously composed, besides,
of various small pieces of wood, including
portions of “the Elderslie Oak,” “Queen Mary’s
Yew,” the “Bush abune Traquair,” and other
celebrated inmates of the forest, which have been
consecrated by the historical and poetical Muse of
Scotland. This elegant little national gem was
with much propriety presented to, and graciously
accepted by, his Majesty, during his residence in
Scotland. Thus, after a lapse of ages, the root of
that oak which had preserved the houseless patriot
when outlawed by the enemies of his country,
has, by a strange vicissitude, been transplanted
to the personal possession of the legitimate descendant
of that race of kings for whose right he
so nobly contended, and whose beloved representative
now wields a sceptre over a countless accumulation
of subjects, and a dominion from which
the sun may be said never to withdraw his light.</p>

<p>The wood-cut which we are now about to
introduce, shows the state of the tree in 1789, at
which time it measured twenty-four feet in height.
It is taken from a drawing with which the publishers
have been politely favoured by the family of the
late Mr A. Kincaid, a gentleman of literary attainments,
to whom the public are indebted for a History
of Edinburgh, and some other meritorious publications;
and who visited the Torwood, and made
the following sketch in the year above mentioned.
Although exhibiting the same general appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
as the drawing made by Mr Nasmyth eighteen
years earlier, which forms the vignette to this
volume, it will be observed that it was gradually
hastening to decay; and, as partially filling up a
<i>hiatus</i> in the history of the “august vegetable,” we
have much pleasure in presenting it to our readers.</p>

<p>In the preceding year, at the depth of a foot
from the surface, and about 30 feet west of
Wallace’s tree, the head of an ancient Scottish
spear was found, which was presented to the
Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, by Mr Alexander
Kincaid. By the kindness of that learned
body, we are also enabled to give the following
wood-cut of this antique and once-powerful
weapon. It measures 8 inches in length, and,
if not of higher antiquity, was probably one of
those used in the fatal conflict which took place
in the Torwood between James III. and his rebellious
nobles in 1488.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE CRAWFURDS.<br /></span>

<span class="subhead"><a href="#Page_193">Page 193.</a></span></h2>

<p>Crawfurd, is a corruption of two Celtic words
<i xml:lang="cel" lang="cel">Crodh-Phort</i>, pronounced <i>Cro-forst</i>, signifying <i>a
sheltering place for cattle</i>, a designation expressive
of the general appearance of the parish of Crawford-John.
As every thing relating to so illustrious
a character as Wallace is important, the following
pedigree, showing his maternal descent,
will doubtless be acceptable to many.</p>

<p>According to that accurate genealogist <i>George
Crawfurd</i>, author of the <i>Scottish Peerage</i>, and
the <i>History of Renfrewshire</i>, and of the <i>House of
Stewart</i>, published more than 100 years ago, the
Craufurds are derived from Thorlongus, an Anglo-Danish
chief, who, being expelled from Northumberland
by William the Conqueror, found an asylum
in Scotland, and, in particular, had a grant of
land in the Merse from Edgar, King of Scots,
whose reign is included betwixt the year 1097
and the 8th January 1106&ndash;7.</p>

<p>This appears from <i>Crawfurd’s</i> MS. “History of
the Craufurds,” in the Advocates’ Library, and is
corroborated by <i>Anderson</i> in his <i>Diplomata</i>, compiled
at the desire of the Scots Parliament, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
has this notice of Thor-Longus:&mdash;“Hic vir nobilis
et Anglus genere fuisse, videtur ac forte idem
qui <i>Thor</i> in Libro vulgo dicto <i>Doomsday-Book</i>,
sæpius memoratus amplissimis suis prædiis in borealibus
Angliæ partibus sitis a Gullielmo Conquisitore
erat exûtus.”</p>

<p>At what particular time his expulsion took
place, does not precisely appear; but it seems
probable that it must have been betwixt the years
1069 and 1074, when, from the unsubmissive spirit
of the Northumbrians, they brought down on
their own heads the most direful wrath of the conqueror,
who was so provoked with them, for joining
their original countrymen the Danes, who had
at that time invaded England, (and whom, for all
his prowess, he was fain to buy off), that “he
swore by the splendour of God he would not leave
a soul alive;” and so soon as he found it in his
power (the foreigners being now gone) to be avenged
of them, he ravaged their country in so merciless
a manner, that for 60 miles together he did
not leave a single house standing.&mdash;See <i>Rapin</i>,
vol. i. p. 172.</p>

<p>All this took place betwixt the years as above
stated; and as they were quite subdued by the last
of these dates (1074), and as there appeared to have
been no more exterminating spoliation of this part
of the country afterwards during William’s reign,
it seems to be a fair conclusion, that this Anglo-Danish
chief had found it necessary to fly, and
make his escape to Scotland during the interim
mentioned. The era of the <i>Doomsday-Book</i> itself
(1079), in which Thor is mentioned to have
been, before that time, deprived of his possessions,
should be a concluding evidence of the fact. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>

<p>This historian deduces the Crawfurds from the
above Thorlongus, in the following order of <span class="locked">succession:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>I. Thorlongus, who has charters as above in
the reign of King Edgar (<i>inter</i> 1097 <i>et</i> 1107),
and whose seal in the first is quite entire, had two
sons; 1. Swane; 2. William, whose name appears
in a charter by William de Vetereponte, in the archives
of Durham.</p>

<p>II. Swane, son of Thorlongus, whose name appears
in several charters of the same age, as in
one by king Edgar to the monastery of Coldingham,
of the lands of Swinton; also in one of the
reign of David I., as possessing the Fishery at
Fiswick, near Berwick, and others in these archives.</p>

<p>III. Galfredus, son of Swane, also mentioned
in these archives. He is stated by Crawford to
have had two sons; 1. Hugh, the next in this line;
2. Reginaldus, of whom afterwards.</p>

<p>IV. Hugh, the eldest son of Galfredus, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
whom came the Crawfords of Crawford proper, as
under.</p>

<p>V. Galfredus de Crawford, who is a witness to
a charter of Roger, Bishop of St Andrew’s, to the
monastery of Kelso, in 1179, and died about 1202.</p>

<p>VI. Reginald de Crawford, probably his son, is
witness to a charter of Richard le Bard to the
same monastery, together with William, John and
Adam, his sons, in 1228. Of the first and third
no other memorial exists. The second,</p>

<p>VII. Sir John Crawfurd, his successor, is designated,
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Dominus de eodem miles</i>, in several donations.
He died without male issue in 1248,
leaving two daughters, of whom the eldest was
married to Archibald de Douglas, ancestor of all
the Douglases whose descent can be traced; and
the youngest was married to David de Lindsay of
Wauchopedale, ancestor of all the Lindsays in
Scotland.</p>

<p>The last three are extracted from <i>Wood’s Peerage</i>,
under the title <i>Crawford</i>; and the authorities
are stated on the margin. That these ladies,
the daughters of Sir John Crawfurd, were descended
from Hugh, No. IV., is distinctly mentioned
by <i>Crawfurd</i>, in the MS. History of the
Crawfurds, as above. To return now to the second
son of Galfredus, No. III.</p>

<p><i>Crawfurd</i> further states, that Galfredus, No. III.,
as above, besides Hugh, had another son,</p>

<p>IV. Reginald, with whom another portion of
the barony of Craufurd remained, and that from
him descended his son,</p>

<p>V. John; and hence the distinction of this part
of the barony into Crawford-John. This John,
he adds, is the first on record that used the surname<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
of Craufurd from his lands; and he is mentioned
as a witness to a charter by Arnold, Abbot
of Kelso, in 1140. In the account of Craufurd
of Auchnames, in Renfrewshire, p. 365, it is stated,
that Sir Gregan Craufurd, ancestor of the Dalmagregan
branch of Craufurds, was a younger brother
of Sir John Craufurd of Crawford-John; of
course, he must also have been a son of Reginald,
No. IV. This point may afterwards be more clearly
verified. Suffice it here to say, that this branch diverged
into several, as those of Torringzean, Drongan,
Camlarg, Balquhanny, Liffnoris, &amp;c. all either
now extinct, or whose history is very little known.
They were distinguished by the stag’s head in their
armorial bearings, in allusion to their common ancestor
Sir Gregan’s having rescued David I. from
the attack of a stag which had unhorsed him. This
exploit is said to have taken place near Edinburgh,
in 1127, which date corresponds not unfitly with
the era of his supposed brother, Sir John Craufurd
of Crawford-John, who appears as a witness,
as above-mentioned, in 1140.</p>

<p>VI. Dominus Galfredus de Craufurd, is the
next stated by Craufurd the historian, in the succession
in this line. He lived in the reign of Malcolm
IV. (<i>inter</i> 1153 et 1165), and in that of his
successor William; and is a frequent witness to
the donations of that prince to the abbacy of Arbroath,
particularly in 1179.</p>

<p>VII. Hugh de Craufurd appears to be the next
in succession, though it is more from probable conjecture
than from precise evidence, that he is reported
to be the son of the preceding. But that
this Hugh was father of</p>

<p>VIII. Sir Reginald de Craufurd, sheriff of Ayrshire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
Crawfurd has no hesitation in affirming. This
Sir Reginald, about the beginning of the 13th century,
married the heiress of Loudoun, and from him all
the Crawfurds of that family, and their numerous
cadets, are descended. It would appear that he
had four sons; 1. Hugh; 2. William; 3. John,
from whom is descended the Crawfordland family;
and, 4. Adam.</p>

<p>IX. Hugh carried on the line of Loudoun. He
had two sons; 1. Hugh; 2. Reginald, who was
the first of Kerse.</p>

<p>X. Hugh, the eldest son, was of Loudoun. He
had a son, said to be ancestor of the Baidland
Craufurds, and a daughter, Margaret, who was
married to Sir Malcolm Wallace. She was the
mother of the Guardian of Scotland, Sir William
Wallace, from whom the Bailies of Lamington are
maternally descended.&mdash;<i>Robertson’s “Ayrshire
Families.”</i></p>

<span class="subhead">THE BURNING OF THE BARNS OF AYR.<br /></span>

<span class="subhead"><a href="#Page_201">Page 201.</a></span></h2>

<p>As this is one of those portions of our history
on which Lord Hailes has thought proper to be
sceptical, the following remarks of the learned Dr
<span class="locked">Jamieson<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></span> on the subject maybe satisfactory to the
reader. With respect to the date, it may, with
great propriety, be fixed about midsummer 1297.</p>

<p>“The story of the destruction of these buildings,
and of the immediate reason of it, is supported
by the universal tradition of the country to
this day; and local tradition is often entitled to
more regard than is given to it by the fastidiousness
of the learned. Whatever allowances it may
be necessary to make for subsequent exaggeration,
it is not easily conceivable, that an event should
be connected with a particular spot, during a succession
of ages, without some foundation.</p>

<p>“Sir D. Dalrymple deems this story ‘inconsistent
with probability.’ He objects to it, because
it is said, ‘that Wallace, accompanied by Sir John
Graham, Sir John Menteth, and Alexander Scrymgeour,
constable of Dundee, went into the west of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
Scotland, to chastise the men of Galloway, who
had espoused the part of the Comyns, and of the
English;’ and that, ‘<i>on the 28th August 1298</i>,
they set fire to some granaries in the neighbourhood
of Ayr, and burned the English cantoned in
them.’&mdash;Annals, I. 255, N. Here he refers to
the relations of Arnold Blair and to Major, and
produces three objections to the narrative. One
of these is, that ‘Comyn, the younger of Badenoch,
was the only man of the name of Comyn
who had any interest in Galloway; and he was at
that time of Wallace’s party. The other two are;
that ‘Sir John Graham could have no share in the
enterprise, for he was killed at Falkirk, 22d July
1298;’ and that ‘it is not probable that Wallace
would have undertaken such an enterprise immediately
after the discomfiture at Falkirk.’ Although
it had been said by mistake, that Graham
and Comyn were present, this could not invalidate
the whole relation, for we often find that leading
facts are faithfully narrated in a history, when
there are considerable mistakes as to the persons
said to have been engaged.</p>

<p>“But although our annalist refers both to Major
and Blair, it is the latter only who mentions
either the design of the visit paid to the west of
Scotland, or the persons who are said to have
been associates in it. The whole of Sir David’s
reasoning rests on the correctness of a date, and of
one given <i>only</i> in the meagre remains ascribed to
Arnold Blair. If his date be accurate, the transaction
at Ayr, whatever it was, must have taken
place thirty-seven days afterwards. Had the learned
writer exercised his usual acumen here&mdash;had he
not been resolved to throw discredit on this part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
of the history of Wallace&mdash;it would have been
most natural for him to have supposed, that this
event was post-dated by Blair. It seems, indeed,
to have been long before the battle of Falkirk.
Blind Harry narrates the former in his Seventh,
the latter in his Eleventh Book. Sir David himself,
after pushing the argument from the date given
by Blair as far as possible, virtually gives it up,
and makes the acknowledgment which he ought to
have made before. ‘I believe,’ he says, ‘that this
story <i>took its rise</i> from the pillaging of the English
quarters, about the time of the treaty of Irvine, in
1297, which, as being an incident of little consequence,
I omitted in the course of this history.’
Here he refers to Hemingford, T. I. p. 123.</p>

<p>“Hemingford says, that ‘many of the Scots
and men of Galloway had, in a hostile manner,
made prey of their stores, having slain more than
five hundred men, with women and children.’
Whether he means to say that this took place at
Ayr, or at Irvine, seems doubtful. But here, I
think, we have the nucleus of the story. The <i>barns</i>,
according to the diction of Blind Harry, seem to
have been merely ‘the English quarters,’ erected
by order of Edward for the accommodation of his
troops. Although denominated <i>barns</i> by the Minstrel,
and <i>horreas</i> by Arnold Blair, both writers
seem to have used these terms with great latitude,
as equivalent to what are now called <i>barracks</i>. It
is rather surprising, that our learned annalist should
view the loss of upwards of five hundred men, besides
women and children, with that of their property,
‘as an incident of little consequence,’ in a
great national struggle.</p>

<p>“Major gives nearly the same account as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
Blair. Speaking of Wallace, he says, ‘<span xml:lang="la" lang="la">Anglorum
insignes viros apud <i>horrea</i> Aerie residentes de
nocte incendit, et qui a voraci flamma euaserunt
ejus mucrone occubuerunt</span>.’&mdash;Fol. lxx.</p>

<p>“There is also far more unquestionable evidence
as to the cause of this severe retaliation, than is
generally supposed. Lord Hailes has still quoted
Barbour as an historian of undoubted veracity.

<span class="subhead">MEMOIR OF BISHOP ANTHONY BEK.<br /></span>

<span class="subhead"><a href="#Page_205">Page 205.</a></span></h2>

<p>For the following biographical notice of this ecclesiastical
warrior, who, in ambition, power, and
talents for political intrigue, may justly be considered
as the Cardinal Wolsey of his day, we are
indebted to a work of Nicholas Harris Nicolas,
Esq., a name sufficient to recommend it to all
who have any taste for antiquarian research.</p>

<p>“Of the period of Bek’s birth we have no precise
information. He was a younger son of Walter
Bek, Baron of Eresby; and in the 54th Henry
III. 1270, was signed with the cross on going to
the Holy Land with Prince <span class="locked">Edward,<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></span> who nominated
him one of the executors of his will, which
was dated at Acre in June <span class="locked">1272.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></span> In 3rd Edward
I. 1275, being then a clerk, he was appointed
Constable of the Tower of <span class="locked">London;<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></span> and was
constituted Archdeacon of Durham as early as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
<span class="locked">1273.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></span> He was present in the Parliament at
Westminster at the feast of St Michael, 6th Edward
I. 1278, when the King of Scotland did
homage to <span class="locked">Edward;<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></span> and on the 9th July 1283,
was elected Bishop of Durham. The ceremony
of his consecration was performed by the Archbishop
of York, in the presence of the King, on
the 9th of January following; but at his enthronization
at Durham on Christmas eve, a dispute
arose between the official of the Archbishop of
York and the Prior of Durham, as to the right of
performing the office, which the bishop-elect terminated,
by receiving the mitre from the hands of
his brother, Thomas Bek, Bishop of St David’s.
On the festival of St John the Evangelist, he
presented the church with two pieces of rich
embroidery, wrought with the history of the Nativity.</p>

<p>“It is impossible to state even the principal occasions
on which Bishop Bek was conspicuous;
it being perhaps sufficient to observe, that scarcely
a single event of any importance took place during
the reign of Edward the First, whether of war or
diplomacy, but in which he was concerned. Several
facts might be mentioned which tend to
prove the influence that he at one time possessed
over the mind of his sovereign. According to
Fordun, it was by his advice that Edward supported
the claim of Baliol instead of that of <span class="locked">Bruce,<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
in the competition for the crown of Scotland; and
he was frequently a mediator, not only between
the King and his barons, but between his Majesty
and his children. The Prelate’s ambition was
equal to his resources; and both were evinced by
the splendour of his equipage, and the number of
his followers. If his <span class="locked">biographer,<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></span> from whom Mr
Surtees has derived a great part of his statements,
may be believed, the retinue with which he attended
the King in his wars amounted to twenty-six
standard-bearers of his <span class="locked">household;<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></span> one hundred
and forty knights, and five hundred horse;
and one thousand foot marched under the consecrated
banner of St Cuthbert, which was borne
by Henry de Horncestre, a monk of Durham.
The Bishop’s wealth and power soon, however, excited
the suspicion of the King; and the process
of ‘quo warranto’ was applied, with the view of
reducing them. His temporalities were seized,
but he recovered them after an appeal to Parliament;
and his palatine rights were confirmed in
the most ample manner by the Justices Itinerant
in 1293. From the proceedings in Parliament in
the 21st Edward I., it seems, that on the Wednesday
before the feast of St James the Apostle, in
the 20th Edward I., namely, on the 23d July
1292, at Derlyngton, and afterwards at Alverton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
and other places, the Archbishop of York had formerly
excommunicated the Bishop of Durham, he
being then engaged in the King’s service in the
North; for which offence the Archbishop was imprisoned,
but pardoned on paying a fine of 4000
<span class="locked">merks.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></span> Bek’s frequent quarrels with the Prior
of Durham, whom he had of his own authority
deprived and ejected, soon afforded a pretext for
the royal interference; and a formidable attack
was afterwards made upon his possessions. About
the same time he espoused the popular cause
by joining the Earl Marshal and the Earl of
Hereford against the crown; and when charged
by the King with deserting his interests, he boldly
replied, ‘That the Earls laboured for the advantage
and honour of the sovereign and his realm,
and therefore he stood with them, and not with
the King, against them.’ In the meanwhile he
obeyed a second citation to Rome, for having deprived
the Prior, where he appeared with his
usual magnificence, and triumphed over his adversaries,
by obtaining from the Pontiff a confirmation
of his visitorial superiority over the convent.
By quitting the realm without license, he
exposed himself to the enmity of the crown; and
his vassals availed themselves of his absence to
urge their complaints. The Palatinate was seized
into the King’s hands; and, in July 1301, the
temporalities of the see were committed to the
custody of Robert de Clifford. In the parliament
in the following year, having effected a reconciliation
with his vassals, and submitted to the
King, the bishop obtained a restitution of his temporalities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
But Bek’s intractable spirit soon involved
him in fresh disputes with the Prior; and
being accused of having infringed on the dignity
of the crown, by some instruments which he had
obtained from Rome, his temporalities were, in
December 1305, once more seized; and the King
seems to have used every exertion, not only to
humiliate the haughty prelate, but to divest his
see of some part of its extensive territories. From
this time until Edward’s demise, he continued
under the royal displeasure; but no sooner was
Edward the Second on the throne, than he added
to his power and titles, by procuring the dignity
of King of the Isle of Man, together with ample
restitution of what had been arrested from him by
the late monarch.</p>

<p>“It is here, however, necessary to refer to the
notice of the Bishop in the poem.” (See Siege
of Carlaverock). Mr Surtees has evidently adopted
the translation given of it in the ‘Antiquarian
Repertory,’ where the words ‘uns plaitz’
are rendered ‘a wound,’ as he says, ‘the Bishop
of Durham is described in the roll of Carlaverock,
as being absent from the siege on account of a
wound; whereas the passage is presumed to have
meant, that the Bishop was detained in England in
consequence of a treaty on some other public transaction.
It appears that he then sent the King one
hundred and sixty men-at-arms; and at the battle
of Falkirk, he is stated to have led the second division
of the English army with thirty-nine <span class="locked">banners.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></span>
In the 35th Edward I., being sent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
Rome with other Bishops and the Earl of Lincoln,
to present some vessels of gold to the Pope
from the King, his Holiness conferred on him the
title of Patriarch of <span class="locked">Jerusalem.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></span> Thus, Mr Surtees
remarks, on receiving the sovereignty of the
Isle of Man, ‘his haughty spirit was gratified by
the accumulated dignities of Bishop, Count Palatine,
Patriarch and King.’ The last political
transaction of his life was his union with the Earl
of Lancaster, against Piers de Gaveston, in 1310;
and, on the 3d of March following, 1310&ndash;11, he
expired at his manor of Eltham in Kent.</p>

<p>The character of Anthony Bek is given with
more elegance than truth in the Poem. ‘The
mirror of Christianity’ is an emphatic allusion to
his piety and virtue; and his wisdom, eloquence,
temperance, justice and chastity, are as forcibly
pointed out, as the total absence of pride, covetousness
and envy, for which he is said to have
been distinguished. But this is rather a brilliant
painting, than a true portrait; for, if all the other
qualities which are there ascribed to him be conceded,
it is impossible to consider that humility
formed any part of his merits. His latest biographer,
Mr Surtees, has however described him
with so much discrimination and elegance, that
his words are transferred to these pages, because
they form the most appropriate conclusion of this
sketch, and powerfully tend to redeem its many
imperfections.</p>

<p>“‘The Palatine power reached its highest elevation
under the splendid pontificate of Anthony Bek.
Surrounded by his officers of state, or marching at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
the head of his troops, in peace or in war, he appeared
as the military chief of a powerful and independent
franchise. The court of Durham exhibited all
the appendages of royalty; nobles addressed the
Palatine sovereign kneeling; and, instead of menial
servants, knights waited in his presence-chamber
and at his table, bare-headed and standing. Impatient
of control, whilst he asserted an oppressive
superiority over the convent, and trampled on the
rights of his vassals, he jealously guarded his own
Palatine franchise, and resisted the encroachments
of the crown when they trenched on the privileges
of the <span class="locked">aristocracy.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></span> When his pride or his patriotism
had provoked the displeasure of his sovereign,
he met the storm with firmness; and had
the fortune or the address to emerge from disgrace
and difficulty, with added rank and influence.
His high birth gave him a natural claim to
power; and he possessed every popular and splendid
quality which could command obedience, or
excite admiration. His courage and constancy
were shown in the service of his sovereign. His
liberality knew no bounds; and he regarded no
expense, however enormous, when placed in competition
with any object of pleasure or <span class="locked">magnificence.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></span>
Yet, in the midst of apparent profusion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
he was too prudent ever to feel the embarrassment
of want. Surrounded by habitual luxury,
his personal temperance was as strict as it was
singular; and his chastity was exemplary, in an
age of general <span class="locked">corruption.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></span> Not less an enemy
to <span class="locked">sloth<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></span> than to intemperance, his leisure was
devoted either to splendid <span class="locked">progresses<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></span> from one
manor to another, or to the sports of the field;
and his activity and temperance preserved his faculties
of mind and body vigorous, under the approach
of age and infirmity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
“‘In the munificence of his public works he rivalled
the greatest of his predecessors. Within
the bishopric of Durham he founded the colleges
of Chester and Lanchester, erected towers at Gainford
and Coniscliff, and added to the buildings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
Alnwick and Barnard Castles. He gave Evenwood

founded at <span class="locked">Auckland.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></span> In his native county of

Notwithstanding the vast expenses incurred in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
these and other works, in his contests with the
crown and with his vassals, in his foreign journeys,

close to the holy shrine. A brass, long since destroyed,
surrounded the ledge of the marble, and
bore the following inscription:</p>

<span class="subhead"><a href="#Page_216">Page 216.</a></span></h2>

<p>In this account of the expedition to Loch-Awe,
the statements, as the reader will perceive, are all
taken from the pages of the Minstrel. The writer
was induced to do so, not from the circumstance
of Henry being the only ancient author who has
recorded the transaction, but from the evidence of
its truth, which may be found in the traditions of
the country where the conflict took place. These
have already been alluded to in the Introduction.
It may not, however, be improper to state, that
“<i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">Uagh Mhac Phadan</i>,” or M’Fadyan’s cave,
can still be pointed out by old Highlanders, who
add, on the authority of tradition, that the determination
with which the Irish leader defended
himself was such, that his pursuers had to throw
down bundles of burning furze into the cave before
he surrendered. The rock on which his head
was afterwards set up, still goes by the name of
<i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">Beinnean Mhac Phadan</i>, the <i>Peak or Pinnacle
of MacFadyan</i>. In short, the localities of the
country are so correctly described, particularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
the scene of the battle, which appears to have
been on the comparatively open space between
<i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">Crag-an-àradh</i> and the rock of <i>Bradhir</i> or <i>Brandir</i>,
as it is called, for the convenience of the
English reader, that few who have had an opportunity
of contrasting the scenery with the account
of the Minstrel, can resist the impression of its
being either the work, or translated from the work,
of an eyewitness. This, taken in connection with
the evidence afforded by the coins of Edward I.,
which from time to time have been found about
the ruins of Ardchattan priory, and which have
also been previously adverted to in the “Introduction,”
ought to be pretty conclusive as to the
occurrence narrated.</p>

<p>This subject has already engaged the attention
of a literary <span class="locked">gentleman<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></span> of talent and intelligence,
who has handled the matter with no small degree
of acumen. The following extracts may therefore
be interesting to those readers who have not
had opportunities for personal investigation.</p>

<p>“Blind Harrie has very particularly related the
circumstances of MacPhadian’s proceedings; and
his account so exactly coincides with the tradition
and topography of the district where the facts are
said to have been performed, that there can be
little or no doubt of the truth of his narration.</p>

<p>“Loch-Awe, upon the banks of which the
scene of action took place, is thirty-four miles in
length. The north side is bounded by wide muirs
and inconsiderable hills, which occupy an extent
of country from twelve to twenty miles in breadth,
and the whole of this space is enclosed as by a circumvallation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
Upon the north it is barred by
Loch-Eitive, on the south by Loch-Awe, and on
the east by the deep and dreadful pass of Brandir,
through which an arm of the latter lake opens
at about four miles from its eastern extremity,
and discharges the river Awe into the former.
The pass is about three miles in length; its east
side is bounded by the almost inaccessible steeps
which form the base of the vast and rugged mountain
of Cruächan. The craigs rise in some places
almost perpendicularly from the water; and, for
their chief extent, show no space nor level at their
feet, but a rough and narrow edge of stony beach.
Upon the whole of these cliffs grew a thick and
interwoven wood of all kinds of trees, both timber,
dwarf, and coppice; no track existed through
the wilderness, but a winding path which sometimes
crept along the precipitous height, and sometimes
descended in a straight pass along the margin
of the water. Near the extremity of the defile,
a narrow level opened between the water and
the craig; but a great part of this, as well as the
preceding steeps, was formerly enveloped in a
thicket, which showed little facility to the feet of
any but the martins and the wild cats. Along
the west side of the pass, lies a wall of sheer and
barren craigs: from behind they rise in rough,
uneven, and heathy declivities, out of the wide
muir before mentioned, between Loch-Eitive and
Loch-Awe; but in front they terminate abruptly
in the most frightful precipices, which form the
whole side of the pass, and descend at one fall
into the water which fills its trough. At the north
end of this barrier, and at the termination of the
pass, lies that part of the cliff which is called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
Craiganuni: at its foot the arm of the lake gradually
contracts its water to a very narrow space,
and at length terminates at two rocks (called the
rocks of Brandir), which form a straight channel,
something resembling the lock of a canal. From
this outlet there is a continual descent toward
Loch-Eitive, and from hence the river Awe pours
out its current in a furious stream, foaming over a
bed broken with holes, and cumbered with masses
of granite and whinstone.</p>

<p>“If ever there was a bridge near Craiganuni
in ancient times, it must have been at the rocks of
Brandir. From the days of Wallace to those of
General Wade, there were never passages of this
kind; but in places of great necessity, too narrow
for a boat, and too wide for a leap, even then they
were but an unsafe footway, formed of the trunk
of trees, placed transversely from rock to rock,
unstripped of their bark, and destitute of either
plank or rail. For such a structure there is no
place in the neighbourhood of Craiganuni, but at
the rocks above-mentioned. In the lake, and on
the river, the water is far too wide; but, at the
strait, the space is not greater than might be
crossed by a tall mountain pine, and the rocks on
either side are formed by nature like a pier. That
this point was always a place of passage, is rendered
probable by its facility, and the use of recent
times. It is not long since it was the common
gate of the country on either side the river
and the pass. The mode of crossing is yet in the
memory of people living, and was performed by
a little currach moored on either side the water,
and a stout coble fixed across the stream from
bank to bank, by which the passengers drew themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
across, in the manner still practised in places
of the same nature. It is no argument against the
existence of a bridge in former times, that the
above method only existed in ours, rather than a
passage of that kind which might seem the more
improved expedient. The contradiction is sufficiently
accounted for, by the decay of timber in
the neighbourhood. Of old, both oaks and firs
of an immense size abounded within a very inconsiderable
distance; but it is now many years since
the destruction of the forests of Glen-Eitive and
Glen-Urcha has deprived the country of all the
trees of a sufficient size to cross the strait of
Brandir; and it is probable, that the currach was
not introduced till the want of timber had disenabled
the inhabitants of the country from maintaining
a bridge. It only further remains to be noticed,
that at some distance below the rock of
Brandir there was formerly a ford, which was used
for cattle in the memory of people yet living.
From the narrowness of the passage, the force of
the stream, and the broken bed of the river, it
was, however, a dangerous pass, and could only
be attempted with safety at leisure, and by experience.</p>

<p>“Such is the topography of the country in
which, tradition says, that Sir Niel Campbell made
his retreat and refuge. It now remains to show,
what correspondence there is between its features,
and the relation given by Blind Harrie. The
words of the Minstrel are as follows:</p>

<p>The correspondence between the above description
and the account which I have before
given of the topography of the Pass of Brandir,
must be evident to every examiner. But the identity
of that place and the one mentioned in the
poem, is confirmed to a degree of certainty; first,
by the fact, that such a correspondence can be
found in no other part of the neighbouring districts;
and, secondly, by the mention which is
made in the description of the poem, of names
which <i>now</i> exist in the appellation of the place to
which it is supposed to apply. ‘Avis’ is well
known to have been the ancient name of Loch
<span class="locked">Awe,<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></span> and is often met with in old poems which
make mention of that lake; and Cragunyn is clearly
but a mis-spelling of ‘Craiganuni,’ the name
of the rocks at the extremity of the Pass of Brandir.
The error is merely owing to the ignorance
of the transcribers of the poem, who did not understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
Gaëlic orthography. Except by persons
very competently masters of the language of the
country, there is scarcely a name in the Highlands
more correctly written at the present day.</p>

<p>“It is easy to show the solitude of the correspondence
between Blind Harry’s description of
the position of Sir Niel, and the topography of
the Pass of Brandir. In the eighth line of the
passage above quoted, it is said, that when the
Campbell had gained the craig to which he retreated,
he ‘baid’ (abode) fast upon Loch-Avis.
From whence it is plain, that this post was immediately
above the shore of Loch-Awe. In the
brief notices of MacPhadian’s situation at the same
period, it is equally evident, that he was entangled
in a narrow and dangerous pass, bounded on one
side by rocks, and on the other side by the lake.
It is expressly said that he was on the opposite
side from the Campbells. The water was then
between them, and yet their positions were communicable
by a bridge and a ford. In the whole
sixty-eight miles, which form the circuit of Loch-Awe,
there is not a spot where these circumstances
could have existed except in the Pass of Brandir.
On no part of the shore is there a pass of
the nature and difficulty implied in Blind Harry’s
notices of MacPhadian’s embarrassment except
there. Neither is there any part of the lake
which could be interposed between two bodies
of men, and yet rendered evadable by a
bridge, except the arm which terminates in the river
Awe. In all other places the water is from one
to three miles wide, and does not contract into any
stream or inlet which could prolong its barrier sufficiently
to prevent it from being turned, and yet admit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
of its being evaded by a passage of the nature
above mentioned. But in the Pass of Brandir all
these particulars are identically to be traced. The
narrowing of the lake to an inconsiderable channel,
and its prolongation into the river Awe, by which
the former might be interposed as a barrier, and
yet evaded by an immediate crossing; the bridge
mentioned by Blind Harry as having existed at the
foot of Craigunyn, and the probability that one
formerly did exist in the corresponding spot of
Craiganuni; the ford described as having been the
only remaining communication in the separating water,
its dangerous character, and the actual being
of a pass of the same nature, and the same relative
position in the water of Awe, all give the strongest
evidence of the truth of the Minstrel’s relation,
and the application of the scene which he has described.
Having then established so much from
the circumstances of the poem and the nature of
the country, we may draw a clear deduction of the
proceedings and motives of Sir Neil Campbell previous
to his entering Craiganuni.</p>

<p>“Allowing that this spot was the place to
which that chief retreated from MacPhadian, it
follows as a necessary consequence, from the situation
of the latter at the breaking of the bridge,
that he must have made his pursuit round the east
end of Loch-Awe; and it will very clearly appear,
that he could not have chosen this direction, had
he not been enticed into it by a similar route in
the flight of the Campbell. The proof that MacPhadian
did take the direction which I have advanced,
is sufficiently decisive. We are expressly
told, that when Sir Neil had gained Craiganuni, he
was stopped in his pursuit on the opposite, or <i>east</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
side of the water beneath. Now, as he possessed
no vessels on Loch-Awe, he could not have gained
this side of the arm of the water which runs
under Craiganuni, had he not come to it by encircling
the east end of the whole lake, which is only
four miles distant. The conviction of this fact
leads decisively to discover the march of Sir Neil.
It is perfectly evident that he must have entered
the heights from the same side as that on which
it is apparent MacPhadian endeavoured to follow
him; for, had he proceeded to Craiganuni by the
west end of the lake, or crossed the water any
where west of the Pass of Brandir, his enemy could
have had no motive in taking the eastern route. In
the first instance, he would have marched in an
opposite direction to those whom he was pursuing;
and in the second, he would have taken a road,
which, allowing it might have been the shortest,
would have placed between him and his enemy an
impassable barrier, and have entangled him in a
strait and dangerous labyrinth, where his numbers
would have become useless, his attacks impracticable,
and his retreat dangerous. Among such
difficulties, it is not to be supposed that MacPhadian
would voluntarily and unnecessarily have hazarded
his success and his safety; he could only,
therefore, have been enticed into them, by the allurement
of pursuing upon the footsteps of his enemies.
The proceedings of Sir Neil are thus reduced
to a degree of certainty, and leave no alternative
from the circumstances which I have
pointed out.</p>

<p>“He observed, that entered from the east, and
having his enemy on that side, Craiganuni was the
most inaccessible and advantageous hold in all Argyleshire;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
but that entered and attacked from the
opposite direction, all the securities of the place
were converted into dangers. Placed then on this
quarter, it was only by a stratagem that he could
win the desired advantage; and in prosecution of
its attainment, he adopted the only plan which
could have been unforeseen by his enemy, and
carried into execution with a certainty of success.
At the approach of MacPhadian into Nether Loch-Awe,
he fled before him along the south side, and
towards the east end of the lake. Drawn after
him by the consciousness of superiority, and the
facility of the pursuit, the Irish Captain followed
him with no thought but the eagerness of capture.</p>

<p>“The advantage, however, of Sir Neil in point of
time, was sufficient to prevent him from falling into
his hands in the open district from Inch-Connel
to Glen-Urcha; and suddenly turning the head of
the lake, and circling towards the west, he dived
down the Pass of Brandir, crossed the water, broke
down the bridge, ascended the height, and threw
between him and his pursuers, the craigs, the rivers,
and the lakes. It was then that the plan of
the chief was seen in all its superiority.</p>

<p>“Had he passed round the west end of the lake,
or crossed it westward of the Pass of Brandir, he
would have entered that wide and open country
which I have before described,&mdash;a country every
where untenable, and so surrounded by natural
barriers, that it would have been almost impossible
for him to have evacuated it under the closeness
of his pursuit. Craiganuni, which had been before
him, would have been not only totally unserviceable
to him, from the direction in which he entered;
but its barriers, lying wholly in his rear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
would have made it the most dangerous situation.
Had he been beset in the moors, the multitude of
his enemies had devoured him; had he been overtaken
at the craig, his flight would have been cut
off by the gulf below; and those who had fled
from the sword would have been driven over the
precipices, and plunged into the water. Had he
escaped these alternatives of ruin, every hardship
would have been presented to his retreat. The
country round the pass was wild and barren, even
to horror and desolation; and had he succeeded
in gaining it with security, he must have pursued
his flight, hopeless of reinforcement and straitened
for subsistence. By the tactic upon which he acted,
he not only avoided all the evils, but converted
the whole of their disadvantages to the inconvenience
of his enemy. The instant he had occupied
Craiganuni, and broken down the bridge over the
mouth of the river, he was inaccessible on every
side, and possessed in his rear a tract of nearly
three hundred square miles, wholly open to his
operations, but secured from his enemies by the
same barriers which rendered himself unapproachable.
In front, the depth of the water, and the
precipices of the pass, were an insurmountable
barrier; on the north, Loch-Eitive continued the
line of circumvallation from the sea to Beann
Starabh; and on the south it was extended by
Loch-Awe from Lorn to Glen-Urcha. Sir Niel
was thus encompassed by a formidable barrier of
seventy-three miles in circumference; and from
the obstacles of this cordon, and the security of
the wide space in his rear, he could at pleasure
have evacuated his position under cover of the
night, and have retreated, in unmolested security,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
to Loch-Fine, from whence he might have proceeded
in his galleys to the coast of Airshire, and
here joined himself with the successful associates
of the late victorious Wallace.</p>

<p>“I have said nothing of the ford through the
Awe, by which there was an approach to the position
of Sir Niel, nor of the capability of MacPhadian,
to have passed Loch-Eitive by means of
his fleet; of the first, the enemy feared to avail
himself from the danger of the passage, and the
want of discipline among his troops; and from
the second, he could have reaped little avail, since,
in the consumption of time necessary to have
brought round these vessels from the sea, Sir
Niel might have abandoned his position, and in
one night have made good his retreat beyond
Loch-Awe.</p>

<p>“Thus baffled and out-manœuvred, MacPhadian
not only failed in his object of offence, but
found himself drawn into an intricate and desolate
labyrinth, where his multitude encumbered themselves;
the want of subsistence prevented him
from remaining to blockade Sir Niel, and his ignorance
of the clues of the place made it difficult
to extricate himself by a retreat. In this exigence
he was desirous of returning to Nether Loch-Awe,
where there was abundance of cattle and game for
the support of his men. At length he discovered
a passage between the rocks and the water; the
way was only wide enough for four persons to
pass abreast; yet as they were not in danger of

“Here we must leave Mac-Phadian, and return
to Duncan of Lorn. In his youth the latter had
been a school-companion of Wallace at Dundee;
and he now determined to resort to him, and make
use of their old acquaintance to prevail on the
champion of Scotland to come to the assistance of
Sir Niel Campbell. As soon, therefore, as Mac-Phadian
had evacuated the Pass, Duncan descended
from Craiganuni, and pursued his way for the
Low country, attended only by a single follower,
named Gillemichel. This faithful clansman was
an aged man, but even in his age was still famous
for an uncommon speed of <span class="locked">foot,<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></span> and on their return
performed good service for his master. When
Duncan arrived in the Low country he found the
Wallace at Dundaff, with Sir John the Græme. The
patriot chieftain had just returned from the overthrow
of the English in the Barns of Air and the
city of Glasgow; and besides the friends and forces
who had come to him upon those occasions, he
had been joined by Malcolm, Earl of Lennox, and
Richard of Lundi, who brought with them a considerable
number of their followers. No sooner
had Wallace heard the tidings of Duncan MacDougall,
than he resolved to go to the aid of Sir Niel
Campbell; and, assembling his force, he instantly
set out upon his march. He directed his course
by Stirling, either to gather increase of followers,
or apprehensive of leaving behind him an English
garrison on the threshold of the Highlands. The
castle, however, was not a place to be taken in a
day; and bent upon the destruction of Mac-Phadian,
Wallace would not delay his march to pursue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
the siege in person, but, leaving the Earl of
Lennox to carry on that service, he determined
to push forward his expedition into Argyleshire.
Having assembled his forces at the bridge of Stirling,
and found them to amount to two thousand
men, ‘worthi and wycht,’ he hastened forward
on his way. Duncan of Lorn acted as his guide;
and while they pursued their march, he sent forward
his man Gillemichel to discover intelligence
of the enemy. Blind Harrie proceeds to relate,
that as the army proceeded, it became fatigued
with its march, that a great part of the men and
horses were incapable to continue their way with that
speed which the urgency of the expedition required.
Upon this Wallace determined to divide the
weary from the strong, and to hasten forward with
the latter only, and surprise the enemy before they
could have the opportunity of choosing a position,
where their superiority of numbers could be displayed
to its advantage. For this purpose he divided
his host into two bodies; the first, consisting
of seven hundred men, he chose to haste forward
with himself; and the second, which contained
but five hundred, and which was spent with fatigue,
he left in the rear to follow as well as they
might. Before they continued their march Wallace
again separated the first division into three
companies; the first, consisting of one hundred
men, his own chosen West country veterans, he
led in person as the advance guard; the second,
of the same numbers, he committed to Sir John
the Græme; and the last, to the amount of five
hundred, he gave to Richard of Lundi, with whom
he joined Wallace of Richardtown, his cousin.
After this disposition, the two grand divisions separated:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
that under the leading of Wallace hastened
forward on its march, and, crossing the
mountain in their front, lost sight of their feeble
comrades. In Glen-Dochart they were met by
Gillemichel the scout; with him came Sir Niel
Campbell, who had escaped from Craiganuni, and
at the head of his three hundred clansmen had hastened
to join the approaching aid of Wallace.</p>

<p>“In this part of Blind Harrie’s poem there is
an error, which throws some confusion upon the
traces of the march of Wallace. It appears, however,
to have been the fault of the transcriber or
reciter, and I think may be satisfactorily explained.
The mistake consists in the contradiction of
the name of the place where the host of Wallace
began to fail with fatigue, and of that in which it
is said, that he afterwards met Sir Niel Campbell.
The words of the poem are <span class="locked">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>“Straith-Phillan opens from the <i>west</i> end of
Glen-Dochart towards the <i>north-west</i>; and consequently,
as Wallace came from the <i>south-east</i>, it
must have been the second of the two places in
the succession of his march, and could not, as it
stands in the poem, have been the first. I shall
presently show, that there is every evidence from
the narrative of the Minstrel, and the evidence of
tradition, that Wallace did not pass through Straith-Phillan
in any part of his march. The mention of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
the name, in this place, must therefore have been
an error altogether, arising either from the carelessness
of the transcriber, or from the confusion
of two appellations, something similar in import.
I am inclined to lean to the latter opinion. At
the northern extremity of Straithearn, between the
Glen and Loch-Earn, the mountains form a little
amphitheatre, in the middle of which there is a
small conical hill, once sacred to St Phillan, and
still called by his name. Near its summit was a
holy spring, distinguished also by the name of the
apostle, and at its foot was a small cell of religious,
formed originally by his disciples. It appears
to me highly probable, that Wallace entered the
Highlands by Straithearn; that it was at St Phillan’s
Hill that his men became fatigued; and that
it was this place which the reciter or transcriber of
Blind Harrie’s poem confounded with Straith-Phillan.
This supposition is much supported by the
correspondence between the circumstances mentioned
by the Minstrel, respecting the march of
Wallace, and the route between Straith-Earn and
Glen-Dochart. A few miles north of St Phillan’s
Hill, the old and short track of the country emerges
from the level side of Loch-Earn, and, passing
over the transverse mountains at its extremity, enters
into Glen-Dochart, at the foot of Bean Mòr,
and near the eastern extremity of the lake.</p>

<p>“This was the common Pass used of old by the
Highlanders, before the construction of the roads.
It is a wild and pathless track, but is still used
by shepherds, and is shorter than the modern ‘Rad
mòr an <span class="locked">righ’<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></span> by some miles. The mention which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
Blind Harrie makes of the march of Wallace, after
the separation from his weary men, agrees very
much with this path, and its <span class="locked">direction:&mdash;</span></p>

</div>
<div class="attrib"><i>Book vii.</i> l. 783.
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“The correspondence is made still more near by
the hint which is given of the spot where the men
of Wallace met Sir Niel Campbell. It appears
to have happened immediately upon their entering
Glen-Dochart; and, after having described the
meeting of the two parties, when the Minstrel
tells us, that they resumed their march, he <span class="locked">says&mdash;</span></p>

</div>

<p>“From this it would appear, that Wallace entered
the glen near the extremity of the lake, and
this is the exact point where the mountain path
enters from Loch-Earn.</p>

<p>“From this period of the poem to the conclusion
of the episode of MacPhadian, the relation of
the Minstrel is clear and consistent; and, by the
aid of the tradition of the country, the route pursued
by Wallace may be well identified with the
localities of its existent topography. The oral account,
handed down in Argyleshire, states, that at
the coming of Wallace, MacPhadian and his host
were posted in the northern extremity of the Pass
of Brandir; and that they were there attacked and
overthrown by Sir William and the Campbells. It
will be found, that this account is much confirmed
by the correspondence between the nature of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
country from Glen-Dochart to Loch-Awe, and
the particulars of the route described by Blind
Harrie, as having been pursued by Wallace from
the latter place to the hold where he encountered
MacPhadian: it is still farther avouched by the
exact conformity between the description of the
scene of battle in the poem, and that marked as
its site by the tradition. Immediately after passing
Loch-Dochart, and consequently leaving that
glen, the Minstrel describes the host of Wallace as
entering a moss of such an extent and difficulty,
that it prevented the farther march of the horses,
and obliged the men to dismount and pursue their
way on foot.</p>

</div>

<p>“A short distance beyond the west end of Glen-Dochart,
there is a high and wide tract of moss
and moor, called ‘The Churan Beag,’ which occupies
the most considerable extent of the space
between Glen-Dochart and Glen-Urcha, the entrance
to Loch-Awe. It is difficult to conceive a
more desolate spot, nor one which could more
correspond with the moss noticed by Blind Harrie.
Its whole extent is a vast waste of swamps, gullies,
and broken peat-bags; and its outlets and entrances
are by rugged and steep declivities, embarrassed with
fragments of rocks, and torn into vast chasms by
the torrents which rise on the moss above. Through
this miserable region lies the shortest path from
Glen-Dochart to Glen-Urcha; and though impassable
for horses, yet, in the olden time, when these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
were little used by the Highlanders, it was the
most common thoroughfare between the above-mentioned
places, and is still used, on account of
its brevity, by the shepherds of the country, and
foot-travellers who require expedition. It is several
miles shorter than the way by Straith-Phillan
and Glen-Lochie; for this reason, and also for
its utter solitude, it is highly probable that it
should have been the route chosen by Wallace in
preference to the other. In addition to the proofs
offered in its favour, by the correspondence of its
features with those of the road mentioned by Blind
Harrie, there is the negative confirmation, that
no place of the same nature occurs within the
neighbourhood of Glen-Dochart, in any direction
by which it is probable that the march of Wallace
could have been destined. For this reason, it is,
as I have before hinted, impossible that he could
have passed through Straith-Phillan; for in the
whole way from Glen-Dochart to Glen-Urcha by
that road, there is neither moss nor muir, but plain
straith and narrow glen. From all these circumstances,
it seems very conclusive, that it was
through the moss of ‘the Churan Beag’ that
Wallace took his march, after his junction with
Sir Niel Campbell in Glen-Dochart. But to return
to the relation of the Minstrel.</p>

<p>“Previous to the entrance of Wallace upon the
muir, he mentions that Gillemichel had been again
sent forward to reconnoitre the route. He had
not been long entered the moss, when he met a
scout of MacPhadian, doubtless sent to discover
the approach of Wallace. At the appearance of
Gillemichel, the foeman fled; but his speed was
not sufficient to enable him to outstrip the fleet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
foot of his pursuer, and he was overtaken and
slain. Delivered from this danger of a discovery,
the host of Wallace effected their march through
the Churan in perfect secrecy, and reached the
hold of MacPhadian before their approach was
even known. It may, perhaps, be remarked, that
the paucity of the Minstrel, in his relation of this
part of the march of Wallace, is inconsistent with
the description of the country through which tradition
supposes it to have been made; since the
poem makes no mention of the progress of the expedition
through the intermediate space of ten
miles, which lies between the Churan and the pass
of Brandir, but, from declaring Wallace’s delivery
from the moss, immediately proceeds to communicate
his entrance to the hold, without taking any
notice of his arrival on the shore of Loch-Awe.
But it is to be observed, that, through the whole
march of Wallace, it describes those situations
only, the circumstances of which affect the incidents
of the story. The space from the Churan
being destitute of any feature dangerous or advantageous,
and the grand interest of the episode being
the hold of MacPhadian, the Minstrel appears
to have been absorbed in that object, and to have
passed without regard the intervening way. This
is palpably the fact, by the certain evidence, that,
wherever the post of MacPhadian was situated,
there was between its entrance and the moss passed
by Wallace, a space of water which has not
been mentioned by the Minstrel.</p>

<p>“From this notice of the shore, it is here evident
that Wallace arrived on the banks of some
water immediately previous to entering the position
of his enemy, and that Blind Harrie has neglected
to mention the circumstance. His omission
of the mention of Loch-Awe in his description
of the march of Wallace, is therefore no objection
that the latter was not made in the route
affirmed by tradition.</p>

<p>“From the arrival of Wallace in the hold of
MacPhadian, the account of Blind Harrie corresponds
entirely with the accounts of the oral record,
and the nature of the pass of Brandir. The
place in which the old people of the country point
out the site of the battle, is that narrow stripe of
open space which lies near the northern extremity
of the pass, between the foot of Cruächan and the
narrowing of the lake to the rock of Brandir. The
Minstrel coincides with this account.</p>

</div>
<div class="attrib"><i>Ib. l.</i> 810.
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“From this narrowness of the column, and the
number of Wallace’s men, the whole host could
not have entered within the pass, till the head had
arrived as far as the space before mentioned. The
description of the straitened situation of the position
also agrees with the pass of Brandir:</p>

<div class="poem-container">

</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span></p>
<p>“As soon as the men of Wallace arrived at the
post of their enemies, they fell upon them with
the utmost fury. Their scout having been slain,
as before mentioned, MacPhadian’s followers were
completely surprised and taken at disarray. Undismayed,
however, by this ill fortune, they snatched
up their arms, and rushed to defend the pass
with the boldest resolution. At the first onset,
the Scots bore back their enemies over five acres
of ground; and Wallace, with his iron mace, made
a fearful havoc among the enemy. Encouraged,
however, by MacPhadian, the Irish came to the
rescue; the battle thickened with more stubborn
fury; and for two hours was maintained, with
such obstinate eagerness on both sides, that neither
party had any apparent advantage; and, says
the Minstrel, the fiercest found ‘eneuch’ of fighting.
At length the cause, and the valour of Wallace,
prevailed. The Irish gave way and fled; and
the Scots of their party threw down their arms,
and, kneeling for mercy, Wallace commanded
them to be spared for their birth sake, but urged
forward the pursuit upon the Irish. Pent in by
the rocks and the water, the latter had but little
hope in flight. Many were overtaken and slain
as they endeavoured to climb the craigs; and two
thousand were driven into the lake and drowned.
MacPhadian, with fifteen men, fled to a cave, and
hoped to have concealed himself till the pursuit
was over; but Duncan of Lorn having discovered
his retreat, pursued and slew him with his companions;
and having cut off the head of the leader,
brought it to Wallace, and set it upon a stone
high in one of the craigs, as a trophy of the victory.”</p>

<p>It is presumed the writer will not be far wrong,
if he anticipates a little curiosity on the part of
the reader, respecting the personal history of so
conspicuous a character as the conqueror of Dunbar;
and as our English neighbours consider it a
matter of difficulty, for a Scotsman to be impartial
when the conduct of an enemy of his country happens
to be the subject of his investigation, we
shall, without either denying or admitting the truth
of this allegation, endeavour to escape from the
charge, by giving the following biographical notice
in the elegant language of one of their own <span class="locked">countrymen:<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></span></p>

<p>“John Earl of Warren and Surrey was the
son of William Earl of Warren and Surrey, by his
second wife, Maud, widow of Hugh Bigot, Earl
of Norfolk, and sister and coheiress of Anselm
Marshal, Earl of Pembroke. In 1240, being then
five years of age, he succeeded his father in his
dignities. In 1247 he married Alice, daughter of
Hugh le Brun, Count of March, and uterine sister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
of King Henry the Third; and in the following
year, though he could not have been above thirteen
years of age, he is said to have attended the
Parliament which met at London in the octaves
of the Purification. During the reign of Henry
the Third, he is stated to have filled those stations
which, from his high rank, naturally devolved upon
him, and at the battle of Lewes he served in the
van of the royal army with Prince Edward; but,
together with the Earl of Pembroke, disgracefully
deserted him at the commencement of the action,
and fled first to Pevensey Castle, and from thence
to France. Their flight is thus quaintly alluded
to by Peter de <span class="locked">Langtoft:<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></span></p>

<div class="poem-container">

<span class="iq">“The Erle of Warenne, I wote, he scaped over the se,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sir Hugh Bigote als with the Erle fled he.</span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>“In May following he returned, and claimed the
restitution of his possessions, which, notwithstanding
his treachery to the Prince, the rebellious Barons
had declared to have been forfeited. The
refusal of his demand induced him once more to
change sides, and he confederated with the Earl
of Gloucester for the restoration of the King’s
power, and was present with the royal forces at
the battle of Evesham. Thus his interest, rather
than his honour, seems to have been his sole rule
of action; and unfortunately, such conduct was
then far too general to entail upon those who adopted
it either punishment or reproach. In 1268
he had a dispute with Henry Earl of Lincoln;
and about the same time became involved in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
serious affray with Alan Lord Zouche, relative to
some lands. This affair was attended with great
violence; for, finding that he must submit to the
judgment of a court of law, he abused his adversary
and his son in the strongest terms, and then
assaulted them in such an outrageous manner in
Westminster-Hall, that he nearly killed the baron,
and severely wounded his son. Neither his power
nor influence could save the Earl from the vengeance
of the laws he had so flagrantly violated;
and, though he retired to his Castle at Ryegate,
he was closely pursued by Prince Edward with a
strong force, and, finding that opposition would
be useless, he met the Prince on foot, and implored
the royal clemency with great humility.
For his offence he was fined ten thousand marks;
but this sum was afterwards reduced to eight thousand
four hundred, and he was permitted to pay
it by annual instalments of two hundred marks
each.</p>

<p>“Immediately after the solemnization of the
funeral of Henry the Third at Westminster, the
Earl of Warren and the Earl of Gloucester proceeded
to the high altar, and swore fealty to his
son and successor, King Edward the First. In
the 3d Edward I. he received that monarch at his
castle of Ryegate in so honourable a manner, upon
his return from Gascony, that Edward was induced
to remit him one thousand marks of the
sum which he had been fined for the affair with
Lord le Zouche.</p>

<p>“The next circumstance recorded of the Earl,
is one in which that proud and sturdy spirit for
which he was celebrated, was displayed in a manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
so consonant to the feelings of the present day,
that this nobleman has always been a favourite
character in English biography; and the pencil
was on one occasion employed to perpetuate his
independent conduct. After the enactment of the
statute of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quo warranto</i>, the Earl of Warren was,
under its provisions, questioned by what title he
held his lands; to which inquiry, first unsheathing
an old sword, he is said to have replied, ‘Behold,
my Lords, here is my warranty. My ancestors
coming into this land with William the
Bastard, did obtain their lands by the sword; and
with the sword I am resolved to defend them against
whomsoever that shall endeavour to dispossess
me. For that King did not himself conquer
the land and subdue it, but our progenitors were
sharers and assistants therein.’</p>

<p>“In the 23d Edward I., the Castle of Bamburgh
was intrusted to his custody; and, in the 24th
Edward I., he commanded the forces sent to reduce
Dunbar Castle, which, after a siege of three
days, surrendered to him; and having met the
Scotch army which came to its relief, he defeated
them on Friday the 27th April, and pursued them
several miles from the field of battle, when the
enemy sustained a loss of 10,000 men. Soon after
this event, the Earl was appointed Regent of Scotland;
and in the following year was constituted
general of all the English forces north of the Trent.
But his previous good fortune now deserted him;
and his army sustained a signal overthrow at the
battle of Stirling, in September 1297.</p>

<p>“His misfortune did not, however, lessen him
in Edward’s esteem, for he was immediately afterwards
reappointed to the command of the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
forces; and, in the 28th Edward I., was made
Governor of Hope Castle, in the county of Derby.
In that year, also, he commanded the second squadron
at the siege of Carlaverock, at which time he

<p>“Of the subject of this article, but little that is
favourable to his memory can be said; though his
faults, or more properly his vices, were those of
the age in which he lived. His treachery at the
battle of Lewes has, to apply the beautiful expression
of a distinguished statesman of the present
day, ‘left indelible stains upon his character,
which all the laurels of’ Dunbar ‘cannot cover,
nor its blood wash away;’ whilst his subsequent
conduct was invariably marked by a turbulent and
intractable spirit. Not only was he frequently
embroiled in disputes both with his compeers and
his sovereign, but, with almost unparalleled hardihood,
he dared, in a court of justice, to use personal
violence towards a baron of the realm. That
he should acquire renown in the field, and consequently
become possessed of the King’s esteem, is
perfectly consistent with that impetuous temper
for which he is celebrated. Bravery is, however,
but one redeeming trait in a picture, where all besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
is dark and repulsive; and even the bold
answer relative to his right to his lands, when
properly considered, affords no room for praise;
for the same resolute opposition to such an inquiry
would, there is no doubt, be as readily evinced
to defend any part of his property, if it
had been acquired by the most flagrant injustice
on his part, instead of on that of his ancestors.</p>

<p>“A proof of the estimation in which the Earl was
held by Edward the First, is afforded, in Dugdale’s
opinion, by the fact, that the King issued
precepts, directed to the Bishops of Canterbury
and London, and to several Abbots, commanding
them to cause masses to be said for his soul; but
this testimony of the royal consideration might
have arisen from the near connection between the
Earl and his Majesty, as is shown by the annexed

<h3>II. PERCY</h3>

<p>“If the biographer of an ancient warrior,” says
Mr Nicolas, “is in any degree influenced by that
enthusiasm which deeds of chivalrous courage are
calculated to excite, it is only by more than ordinary
restraint upon his feelings that he is enabled
to relate them in the sober and chastened language
suitable to historical truth; and, perhaps, in no instance
is that caution so necessary as when any
member of the house of Percy is the subject of
his pen. In the age to which Henry de Percy
belonged, as well as in a few succeeding centuries,
that name was synonymous with almost uncontrollable
power, impetuous valour, and all those
stern military virtues which characterized the time;
and the difficulty of successfully detailing the career
of an individual is considerably increased,
when, as in the case of this Baron, the merits of
his descendants have been sung, not only by rude
contemporary bards, but have been immortalized
by the greatest dramatic genius that ever existed.</p>

<p>“Henry de Percy was the third son of Henry
Lord Percy, by Eleanor, daughter of John Earl
of Warren and Earl of Surrey, and succeeded to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
the barony upon the death of his brother John de
Percy, who died under age soon after the year
1272, at which time he appears to have been very
young. The first circumstance recorded of him is,
that, in the 15th Edward I., being then in ward,
on the King’s expedition into Wales, he was acquitted
of 120<i>l.</i> required from him for scutage. In
the 22d Edward I. 1294, he made proof of his age,
obtained livery of his lands, and was summoned to
attend the King into Gascony; and in March
1296, having accompanied Edward in his invasion
of Scotland, he received the honour of knighthood
before Berwick. He was present at the battle of
Dunbar, and was soon afterwards appointed Governor
of Galloway and Aire in Scotland; and in
1297, being with Lord Robert Clifford, commander
for the King of England in the eastern
parts of Scotland, they were appointed to receive
Margery, daughter of Robert Brus Earl of Carreck,
as an hostage for his fidelity to Edward.
About the same time he was sent by the Earl
Warren, then General of all the English army beyond
the Trent, with the forces at Carlisle into
Scotland; and having entered Annandale with 300
men-at-arms, and 40,000 foot, about the 10th
August he proceeded to Aire, where he endeavoured
to persuade the inhabitants of Galloway to
submit. Finding that a party of Scots were on
their route to oppose him, he marched towards
them; but from the inferiority of their numbers, they
surrendered upon condition of being pardoned.</p>

<p>“In the 26th Edward I., Lord Percy was
again in the wars of Scotland, in which year he
obtained a grant of the lands forfeited by Ingelrom
de Umfreville; and in the following year he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
present at the siege of Carlaverock&mdash;a fact unnoticed
by either of the writers just mentioned&mdash;when
he must have been about forty-two years of age.
The poet alludes to his determined hostility against
the Scots, which feeling appears to have been inherited
by his descendants, and describes him as
the ‘nevou’ of the Earl Warren, which, like the
word ‘nepos,’ seems to have been used for grandson
as well as nephew, he being the son of Eleanor,
the daughter of that nobleman. In February,
28th Edward I., 1301, he was a party to the
letter from the Barons to Pope Boniface, wherein
he is styled ‘Lord of Topclive;’ and in the 34th
Edward I., was again sent into Scotland, to oppose
Robert Bruce, against whom he valiantly defended
Kenteir. In the 35th Edward I., he was a
party to the treaty of peace with Scotland.</p>

<p>“On the accession of Edward the Second, he
was, in common with the other peers of the realm,
summoned to attend that monarch’s coronation;
and in the 3d Edward II., he purchased the celebrated
castle of Alnwick, which is now possessed
by his representative the Duke of Northumberland.
In the 5th Edward II., he succeeded John de
Segrave, as Constable of Nottingham Castle, and
Justice of the Forests beyond the Trent, and about
the same period was constituted Governor of
Scarborough and Bamburgh Castles. From a writ
tested on the 14th September, 1309, it appears
that he was then Constable of the Castle of York,
and in that and the preceding years he was again
in the wars of Scotland.</p>

<p>“Lord Percy distinguished himself by his enmity
to Piers de Gaveston, and it is perhaps just
to consider that his hostility arose from patriotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
motives; but there is a suspicion attached to his
behaviour towards the unhappy favourite, which
the biassed historian of the house of Percy has
rather increased than lessened, by his laboured attempt
to remove. It appears that Gaveston was
besieged in Scarborough Castle by the Earl of Pembroke;
that he surrendered upon condition that his
life and person should be secured; and that both
the Earl and Percy solemnly pledged themselves
to that effect. Through a false reliance, however,
on the Earl’s honour, by Percy, as Collins relates
it, the promise was speedily broken, and Gaveston
perished on the scaffold at Warwick Castle. This
is a version of the tale, which so partial a biographer
as that writer uniformly shows himself, would
naturally give; but although the impossibility of
ascertaining the real merits of the case render it
unjust to pass a positive censure upon Percy’s
conduct, it is at least equally unfair to conclude
that the whole shame of the transaction belongs
to his colleague, and that his only error arose from
a misplaced confidence. Certain, however, it is,
that the King considered him guilty of Gaveston’s
death, for he issued special precepts, tested on the
30th and 31st July, 1312, for his apprehension,
and for the siezure of all his lands, tenements, and
chattels. Towards the end of that year, however,
Percy was included in the treaty between the King
and the barons; and on making his submission his
offence was pardoned, and his lands restored to him.
The acquittance of the King to Thomas Earl of
Lancaster, Guy Earl of Warwick, Robert de Clifford,
and this Baron, of the jewels and horses that
belonged to Gaveston, dated on the 6th February,
1313, 6. Edw. II., by which he acknowledges to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>

curious; and with the hope of relieving the dullness
of this memoir, the following interesting extracts
from it are introduced:</p>

<p>“The little that remains to be said of this Baron,
may be related in a very few words. In 1313 he

all his dominions; in June in the following year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>

the 6th February, 27th Edward I. 1299, to the 29th
July, 8th Edward II. 1314. He died in 1315,
and was buried in the Abbey of Fountains in Yorkshire;

<i>Siege of Carlaverock.</i>
</p>

<h3>III. CLIFFORD.</h3>

<p>“Robert de Clifford was the eldest son of Roger
de Clifford, who was accidently slain between
Snowden and Anglesey in 1280. He was born
about Easter, April, 1274, and in the 14th Edward
I., 1286, he succeeded his grandfather in his
baronial honours, being then twelve years of age.
In the 13th Edward I., he was found to be one of
the heirs of Ralph de Gaugy, and paid 100<i>l.</i> for
his relief; after which, the next circumstance which
has been found recorded of him is, that he was
summoned to attend the King, with horse and
arms, on his expedition beyond the sea on the 4th
May, 25th Edward I. 1297; and on the 26th
September following, he was ordered to be at Carlisle,
similarly equipped, to serve against the Scots,
at the ensuing Feast of Pentecost; but Dugdale
asserts, that he was present at the battle of Dunbar,
in 24th Edward I.; that in the 25th Edward I., he
was sent with a hundred men-at-arms and twenty-thousand
foot from Carlisle to plunder in Scotland;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
and that, after much slaughter, he returned with
considerable booty on Christmas eve. In that
year he was also appointed Justice of all the King’s
forests beyond the Trent; in 26th Edward I., he
was made governor of Nottingham Castle; and
on the 27th Edward I., being constituted the
King’s Lieutenant and Captain-General in the
counties of Cumberland, Westmoreland and Lancaster,
and throughout Annandale and the Marches
of Scotland, he was joined in commission with the
Bishop of Durham and others, to consider of the
means of garrisoning the castles in that kingdom, and
for guarding the marches. Clifford was again summoned
to the Scottish wars on the 7th May, 27th
Edward I., 1299, and received his first writ to parliament
on the 29th December in the same year.</p>

<p>“As Clifford did not attain his majority till 1295,
he consequently could not have been above twenty-five
when he was thus honoured with his sovereign’s
confidence,&mdash;a fact which speaks forcibly
in his praise. It was at this period of his life
that he was noticed in the <span class="locked">poem;<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></span> and as his conduct
at Carlaverock is wholly passed over by
his former biographer, it claims especial regard
in this memoir. After stating that he served
in the third squadron, which was led by the
King in person, and extolling Clifford’s valour,
descent and prudence, the writer adds, that if he
were a young maiden, he would bestow on him
his heart and person, in consideration of his renown.
During the siege, we are told that he particularly
distinguished himself, and was rewarded
by being appointed Governor of the Castle when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
it surrendered; in consequence of which, his banner
was placed on its battlements. Clifford was
a party to the letter from the Barons to Pope
Boniface, in the 29th Edward I., February 1301,
in which he is described as “Castellanus de Appelby;”
and, in the 34th Edward I., in recompense
for his numerous services, he obtained a
grant of the borough of Hartlepole, and of all the
lands of Robert de Brus. In the same year, he
was sent with Aymer de Valence against the said
Robert, who had then assumed the title of King
of Scotland; about which time the lands of Christopher
de Seyton were granted to him. Clifford
attended the deathbed of the King in 1307, and
received the dying monarch’s injunctions to prevent
the return of Gaveston into the realm. In
the 1st Edward II., he was again made Governor
of Nottingham Castle, and constituted Earl Marshal
of England; and, on the 31st January 1308,
he joined several other Lords in an engagement to
support the title and honour of the young King
with their lives and fortunes. In the 2d Edward
II. he was constituted Warden of the Marches
of Scotland, and soon afterwards Governor of that
kingdom; and on the 17th March 1309&ndash;10, was
one of the Peers selected to regulate the royal
household. Several valuable grants of lands were
bestowed upon him in the 3d and 4th Edward II.,
in consideration of his merits; and he was again
summoned to serve in Scotland, in the 4th Edward
II. In the 6th Edward II. he was joined
in commission with the Earl of Hereford and
others, to continue a treaty begun at Margate with
the Count of Eureux and the Bishop of Poitou,
upon some important affairs. On the 6th February<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
1313, he received an acquittance from the
King, for the jewels, horses, &amp;c. belonging to
Piers de Gaveston; and he firmly adhered to Thomas
Earl of Lancaster, against the unfortunate favourite,
for his agency in whose death he afterwards
procured the royal pardon.</p>

<p>“Lord Clifford was regularly summoned to parliament
from the 29th December, 28th Edward I.
1299, to the 26th November, 7th Edward II.
1313; and he terminated his career in a manner
strictly consistent with his life, for he fell in the battle
of Bannockburn, on the 25th June 1314, at
the early age of forty years. His body was sent to
King Edward at Berwick, and is supposed to have
been buried at Shapp Abbey, in Westmoreland.</p>

<p>“Clifford married Maud, daughter, and eventually
coheir of Thomas de Clare, steward of Waltham-Forest,
son of Thomas, younger son of
Richard de Clare, Earl of Gloucester and Hertford,
by whom, who survived him, and remarried
Robert, Baron Welles, he had issue Roger, his
successor in the barony, then aged fifteen years,
but who died, <span class="smcap smaller">S. P.</span> in 1337; Robert, brother and
heir of Roger, and, according to some pedigrees,
two other sons, John and Andrew; and a daughter,
Idonea, the wife of Henry Lord Clifford.</p>

<p>“From Robert de Clifford, the second son of the
subject of this article, descended the baronial line
of Clifford, which, in the reign of Henry the Eighth,
was elevated to the earldom of Cumberland. The
barony of Clifford is now possessed by Edward
Southwell, the present Lord de Clifford, the abeyance
having been terminated in favour of his Lordship’s
father in <span class="locked">1776.”<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a></span></p>

<p>Respecting this avaricious and time-serving minion,
few particulars are known. The historians of
his country appear to have left his memory in a
state between obloquy and oblivion, and the odium
he drew upon himself, during his short administration
in Scotland, remains unrelieved by
the relation of any redeeming circumstances on
the part of those who may be supposed intimately
acquainted with his character. Sir Walter
Scott, in his Border Antiquities, mentions, that
he was Rector of Ruddely, Chief Justiciary of
York Assizes, and Prebendary of many churches.</p>

<p>But his numerous ecclesiastical duties were totally
neglected, for the more congenial pursuits
afforded by the cabinet and the camp; and it is
stated, that though in the possession of so many
lucrative benefices, he never assumed the garb
peculiar to his sacred profession. In his character
of Treasurer, he incurred a degree of detestation,
which does not appear to have been attached to
any of the other officers appointed by Edward
to the management of affairs in Scotland. Among
his own countrymen, his peculation occasioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
disgust, and in many instances desertion; while
his short-sighted rapacity chafed the impatient and
angry feelings of a people smarting under the infliction
of a yoke to which they had been hitherto
unaccustomed, and greatly contributed in raising
that spirit of insurrection in which his aggressions
met with the vengeance they had provoked.</p>

following provisions of an act put forth by Edward I.,

monarchs, on the subject of foreign commercial intercourse.
“It is ordained, that no fishmonger shall have
any partnership with a stranger who brings fish from sea
to the city; but let them seek for fish in their <i>own</i> ships,
and permit foreigners to bring it and sell, when they
come in their own ships. Because, by such partnerships,
they who are of the city, and have known the state of the
city, and the defect of victuals, will hold the fish at a
dearer rate than foreigners, who shall not have known it;
and also, that they who are of the city, when they cannot
sell, as they will lay it up in cellars, and sell it <i>dearer than
the strangers would do, if they came without partnership,
and knew not where they might be harboured</i>.”&mdash;Lambert’s

By a charter, dated in April 1291, William de

dig coal for their own use in his lands of Pittencrieff, but
upon no account to sell any, (Chart. in Statist. Account
of Scotland, vol. xiii. p. 469.) By this restriction, it would
seem that the proprietor not only set a value on the sale of
coal, but also that the monks of those days were in the
habit of improving their resources, by trafficking in temporal
as well as in spiritual matters.</p></div>

little perplexity among the learned. He appears to have
made a sort of census of the kingdom, in which the names
of the Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Parsons, Vicars, Abbesses,
Earls, Barons, Knights, Freeholders, and Communities of
cities and burghs, were registered. This roll, in which
their rentals were stated, is known in Scottish history by
the name of “Bagamont’s Roll,” and was always referred
to in disputes respecting church property. For the purpose
of a like assessment, Bagamont appears to have made
a similar census in England. A copy of the Scotch roll,
carried off most likely by Edward, along with the other
documents, from Scone, was found in the Tower of London,
and given to the world, by the more modern historians
of England, as the “Homage Roll of Scotland,”
under the cognomen of “Ragman’s Roll.” The disgrace
which this document seems to infer, is pathetically bewailed
by Abercromby. If he had turned to the learned
Bishop of Carlisle’s Scottish Historical Library, p. 53,
his grief might have been a little assuaged by the following
passage:&mdash;“One of the most ancient repertories of
the primitive state and rights of the Scottish church, is
the old Book of the Taxation of Ecclesiastical Benefices,
whereof Sir John Skene has given us the following account.
<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> ‘The Pape, in the time of King <a name="FNanchor_B" id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> James the Third, sent in
this realm ane cardinal and
legate, called Bagimont: quha did make ane taxation
of all the rentals of the benefices, that the samin might
be knawin to the Pape: to the effect, that, when any
person came to Rome seikin Bulles, or right to ony benefice
fra him, he might conform to the said rental as he
pleased, sell the samin for sa meikle silver or gold as he
thocht maist profitable.’ This is by no means exact, nor
answerable to what we commonly have from that learned
writer; for that very law of <a name="FNanchor_C" id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">C</a> James the Third, to
which he refers, cites this taxation by the name of the
‘Provinciallis Buik, or the auld taxation of Bagimont;’
and shews, that in this King’s time, endeavours were used
to raise the values of the livings above what they were rated
at, to the advantage of the Court of Rome, and against
‘the common gude of the realme.’ This act was confirmed
by his son and successor James the Fourth, who
made <a name="FNanchor_D" id="FNanchor_D" href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">D</a> the crime capital in laymen, ordaining that all
such should ‘tine their life and gudes.’ We are, therefore,
still in the dark as to the true author of this ancient
valuation; being certainly misinformed of the time wherein
he lived, and (perhaps) knowing as little of his proper
name. If I may be allowed to offer my conjecture, I should
guess that this ecclesiastical survey is about the same age
with that which was made (of the lands in England) by
our Edward the First; and possibly the names of <a name="FNanchor_E" id="FNanchor_E" href="#Footnote_E" class="fnanchor">E</a> Rageman
and Bagimont were heretofore one and the same.
What this or the other means, or how both have been corrupted,
let the nicer etymologists inquire.”</p></div>

chronicles of England from Brutus downward. These
fabrications of the cloisters, however, are contradicted by
events, respecting the truth of which the historians of both
countries are agreed. It is rather singular, that when John
became the <i>liegeman</i> of the See of Rome, and, with the

After all that the learned Doctor has advanced on the

that made a great noise in the world at the time, yet
when he became relieved from the scrape, and had got his

were destroyed by fire, a Parliament was held by
Edward in the house of Henry Waleis, Mayor of London,
at Stehenheth, “when crokards, pollards, and rosaries,
coyned in foreign parts beyond seas, and uttered for

a kinsman of William the Conqueror. Having obtained

out in maintaining the castle were afterwards allowed
him, in consequence of a precept sent by Edward to the
Bishops of St Andrews and Glasgow, and the other guardians
of the kingdom. In 22 Edward I. (according to
Dugdale) he was summoned to Portsmouth, with horse
and arms, to attend Edward on his expedition to France;
and in 23 Edward I. he was summoned to Parliament,
but not by the title of Earl of Angus, till 25 Edward I.,
at which time, says the above authority, “our lawyers of
England were somewhat startled, and refused, in their
briefs and instruments, to acknowledge him Earl, by reason
that Angus was not within the kingdom of England,
until he had openly produced the King’s warrant.”</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a name="Footnote_48" id="Footnote_48" href="#FNanchor_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>  Lord Hailes, in remarking on this anecdote, as told
by Buchanan, says, “I suspect, however, that this is nothing
more than an abridgement of Blind Harry in classical
Latin. It may be remarked, by the way, that this is
one of the most specious tales in the book, for it is characteristical.”
The value of his Lordship’s “Historical
Doubts” are now beginning to be appreciated. There
are many tales equally specious, and equally characteristical,
to be found in the book, which his natural acuteness
would have found no difficulty in discovering, had he laid
down the quill of the lawyer, when he took up the pen of
the historian. Mr Tytler gives the story, and quotes Wyntown
as one of his authorities. This is a mistake; Wyntown
is silent on the subject; and I suspect the truth of it
must rest on the evidence of the Minstrel, and traditions
still current in the country, among which are the following:&mdash;“Edward
I. thought Dundee of sufficient consequence
to be occupied by an English garrison; and the
illustrious Wallace (with his companions, John Blair,
probably of the Balthayock family, and Sir Niel Campbell
of Lochaw) is said by tradition to have received his
education at Dundee school, and, in this situation, to
have begun his exploits with the death of the son of the
English Governor.”&mdash;<i>Stat. Account, vol. viii. p. 212, 213.</i>
</p>
<p>
“There is a very respectable man in Longforgan (in
Perthshire), of the name of Smith, a weaver, and the farmer
of a few acres of land, who has in his possession a
stone which is called <i>Wallace’s Stone</i>. It is what was formerly
called in this country a <i>bear-stone</i>, hollow like a
large mortar, and was made use of to unhusk the bear or
barley, as a preparative for the pot, with a large wooden
mell, long before barley-mills were known. Its station
was on one side of the door, and covered with a flat stone
for a seat when not otherwise employed. Upon this stone
Wallace sat on his way from Dundee, when he fled after
killing the governor’s son, and was fed with bread and
milk by the goodwife of the house, from whom the man
who now lives there, and is the proprietor of the stone, is
lineally descended; and here, his forbears (ancestors) have
lived ever since, in nearly the same station and circumstances,
for about five hundred years.”&mdash;<i>Stat. Account,
xix. 561, 562.</i></p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a name="Footnote_54" id="Footnote_54" href="#FNanchor_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>  Before the attack, Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham,
joined the English army, with 140 knights, 500 horse, and
1000 foot, accompanied by the consecrated banners of
St Cuthbert and St John of Beverley; the former carried
by Henry de Horncester, a stout monk of Durham, and
the latter by Gilbert de Grymmesby (so called by the English),
a Scottish Vicar of Beverley College, born in the
district of Kyle in Ayrshire,&mdash;who had spent a great part
of his life in the service of Edward in France, where he
had acted as a pursuivant. The banner of St Cuthbert
accompanied the King only on extraordinary occasions.
The following description of it may not be unacceptable.
</p>
<p>
“This banner was fastened to a staff, five yards in
length. All the pipes were of silver, to be sliven (<i>slipt</i>)
on along the banner-staff; and on the uppermost pipe, on
the height of it, was a little silver cross, and a goodly banner-cloth
pertaining to it, and in the midst of the banner-cloth
was a white velvet, half a yard square every
way, and a cross of crimson velvet over it, and within the
said white velvet was the holy relique, wherewith St Cuthbert
covered the chalice when he said mass, and the residue
of the banner-cloth was of crimson velvet, embroidered
all over with gold and green silk most sumptuously. It
was not carried out but on his anniversary, and some other
principal festivals in procession. It was the clerk’s
office to wait on it in his surplice, with a fair red-painted
staff, having a fork or cleft at the upper end, which cleft
was lined with soft silk, having a down under the silk to
prevent it hurting or bruising the pipes of the banner,
which were of silver, to take it down and raise it up again,
by reason of the weightiness thereof. There were always
four men to wait on it, besides the clerk, and divers who
carried it. This last wore a strong girdle of white leather,
to which the banner was fastened by two pieces of the same,
having at each end of them a socket of horn to put the end
of the banner-staff into.”&mdash;<i>Hist. and Antiq. of Durham
Abbey, p. 118, 120.</i>
</p>
<p>
By the Wardrobe Accounts, it appears that the monk
who carried the banner of St Cuthbert into Scotland, was
paid 1s. per day,&mdash;while he who carried that of St John
was allowed 8½d., and <i>one penny</i> per day to bring it back.</p></div>

of blood flowed through the city for two days.
Langtoft informs us, that Edward was the first to enter
the breach, which he did on his favourite horse, named
“Bayard.” He has omitted to say, if “Bayard” was
<i>a pale horse</i>. This distinguishing trait seems only a-wanting,
to render the description given of this “<i>most

The only man of consequence who fell on the side of
the English, was Sir Richard de Cornwall. He was killed
by a quarrell, shot by a Flemish merchant from the
“Red Hall.” This place was a fortified factory or store,
occupied by a company of Flemings trading in Berwick,
and held by them of the crown of Scotland, on condition
of defending it against the English to the last extremity.
Their knightly devoirs they bravely performed. The fortress
held out the whole day against all the force the English
could bring against it. At night it was set on fire,
and the faithful little band of trading warriors perished in
the flames.</p></div>

(fatal stone), on which the Kings of Scotland,
from the earliest ages of their monarchy, had been crowned.
At the ceremony of their inauguration, a <i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">seanachaidh</i>,
or heraldic bard, clothed in a robe of sky-blue, stood before
the <i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">lia-faile</i>, and recited to the King, as he sat on it,
the genealogy of the Kings of Scotland, from the foundation
of their dynasty. The last performance of this ancient
Celtic custom, was at the coronation of Alexander
III. The person who officiated on that occasion, is said
to have had on a scarlet robe. This, however, was not the
colour used by the Celts, for that office. The person of
the heraldic bard was sacred above all others, and he wore
sky-blue as emblematic of peace. The early history of the
<i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">Lia-faile</i> is involved in the obscurity of fable, and no small
degree of sacredness has been attached to it from the connection
it is supposed to have with the destinies of the
Scots. The following Druidical Oracle, is considered as
first giving currency to this belief.

That part of the history of the <i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">Lia-faile</i> which is considered
authentic, may soon be told.&mdash;It was at an early
period brought from Ireland to Dunstaffnage; from thence
to Scone, in 842, by Kenneth II.; and, lastly, to Westminster,
in 1296. In the Wardrobe Account of Edward,
for March 1299, there is the following entry of a payment
to “Walter the painter, for a step to the foot of the
<i>New Chair, in which the Stone of Scotland</i> was placed,
near the altar, before the shrine of St Edward, in Westminster
Abbey, and to the carpenters and painters painting
the said step; and the gold and colours to paint it with;
and making a case to cover the said chair, L.1: 19: 7.”&mdash;<i>Remarks
on the Wardrobe Account</i>, page xli. Walsingham
says, that the use Edward put it to, was to serve
as a chair for the celebrating priests at Westminster.
</p>

<p>
In the treaty of peace between Robert Bruce and Edward
III., there is a particular stipulation for the restoration
of this Stone. The Londoners, however, had taken
a fancy to it, and excited a commotion to prevent its removal;
and Robert had no difficulty to persuade his people,
to waive the performance of the agreement. Indeed,
so deep-rooted has been the belief of the Scots in the augury
attached to it, that many looked upon the accession
of James to the British throne as the fulfilment of the
prediction. Even in the present day, when there is so
much anxiety evinced for the recovery of objects held in
national estimation, we do not hear of any application
being made to his Majesty for the restoration of the <i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">Lia-faile</i>.
There is no doubt but many of those who witnessed
the original aggression, would console themselves with
the reflection, that the <i>“Lang-shanked Southerone” had
caught a Tartar</i>.</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a name="Footnote_72" id="Footnote_72" href="#FNanchor_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>  Respecting the armour and sword of Wallace, Doctor
Jamieson has the following note. “In the Castle of
Dunbarton, they pretend to show the mail, and, if I
mistake not, also the sword of Wallace. If he was confined
in that fortress by Monteith, before being sent into
England, as some have supposed, it is not improbable
that his armour might be left there. The popular belief
on this head, however, is very strong; of which I recollect
a singular proof, which took place many years ago, and of
which I was an eye-witness. In the procession of King
Crispin, at Glasgow, his majesty was always preceded by one
on horseback, appearing as his <i>champion</i>. In former times,
this champion of the awl thought it enough to wear a
leathern jerkin, formed like one of mail. One fellow,
however, was appointed, of a more aspiring genius than
his predecessors, who was determined to appear in real mail;
and who, having sent to Dunbarton Castle, and hired the
use of Wallace’s armour for a day, made his perambulations
with it through the streets of Glasgow. I can never
forget the ghastly appearance of this poor man, who was
so chilled and overburdened by the armour, that, as the
procession moved, he was under the necessity of frequently
supporting himself with a cordial. It was said that he
took to bed immediately after the termination of this procession,
and never rose from it. From that time forward,
his successors in office were content to wear the proper
badge of their profession.”&mdash;<i>Dr Jamieson’s Notes on Blind
Harry.</i>
</p>
<p>
On this extract from the Doctor’s invaluable work,
the writer has to remark, that information derived from
inquiry made on the subject, does not entirely confirm the
correctness of <i>all</i> the statements that extract contains.
That a man in <i>real armour</i> figured in the procession of
King Crispin at Glasgow, about forty years ago, is a
well-known fact; but that the armour had belonged to
Wallace, is any thing but certain. If so precious a deposit
had been in the charge of the Governor of Dumbarton
Castle, it is conceived he must have possessed more
good nature than became his situation, if he lent it out to
grace any such fooleries. Certain it is, if such armour
was in Dumbarton Castle at the time, it is unknown to
those connected with the garrison at present; and we can
*not conceive that a relic, so valuable in the estimation of
the public, would have totally disappeared, without its being
known what had become of it. The inquiries of the
writer enable him to state, that the mail used on this occasion
was lent to the followers of King Crispin by a gentleman
belonging to Glasgow of the name of Wilsone. It
was plate-armour and highly polished. The sons of the awl,
however, had a taste of their own in such matters, and took
the liberty of painting it in oil, of a colour more to their
fancy. But on being returned in this altered condition, it
was thrown aside by the indignant proprietor. All that
they <i>pretend</i> to show in the Castle of Dumbarton, as having
belonged to Wallace, is a sword of a very antique
fashion, intended to be used with both hands, but by
no means of a weight that would prevent men of ordinary
strength of the present day from wielding it. There
is no proof, however, that it belonged to the Deliverer of
Scotland; and, if we may credit the account given by old
people, of its having been dragged up from the bottom of
the Clyde by the anchor of a vessel about sixty years ago,
its identity becomes more than doubtful. Such, however,
is the prevalence of the report in its favour, that it was
some time since sent to London for the inspection of
certain official characters connected with the Board of
Ordnance. At the time it was sent off, it wanted several
inches of its length, which, it seems, had been
broke off by some accident. Whatever may have been the
opinion of those to whom it was sent, respecting its connection
with Wallace, we know not; but as they were at
the trouble of getting it repaired, in a manner that reflects
credit on the talents of the artist, and returning it with a
handsome scabbard, they have at least paid a compliment
to the prejudice in its favour.</p></div>

that the curiosity of James was excited by the original
narrative of Blair; a book which, from his long captivity
in England, he had perhaps heard little about, till his
return to Scotland. The rehearsal, therefore, of the heroic
achievements of his illustrious countryman, may have produced
all the excitement which the Editor of the Perth

From the many notices we have seen of the discovery
of hidden treasures, we shall select the following, as
alluding more particularly to the period embraced in our
narrative. We cannot, however, agree with the learned
Editor in the opinion, that the coins in question were
hidden by the soldiers of Edward; they held the country
by too precarious a tenure to make such deposits. It is
more likely to have been the share of booty belonging to
some patriot Scot, who had afterwards fallen in the cause
of his country’s independence. “There was lately found,
on the farm of Mr Rankine of Whitehall, parish of New
Cumnock, Ayrshire, by a person employed in turning up
the ground with a spade, about two feet from the surface,
a small vase, of an antique form, similar to those in the
Englefield Collection, and of very coarse materials, containing
about a hundred silver pennies of Alexander III. of
Scotland, and Edward I. of England, in good preservation,
having the head and characters distinctly legible. The
English coins were more numerous than the Scotch.
Those of Alexander represent him in profile, as do all the
coins of his reign, and have round the head, <i>Alexander
Dei Gra:</i>; and on the other side, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Rex Scotorum</i>, with a
cross extending to the edge, and a spur level in each of
the quarters. This coin is No. 33, first page of plates appended
to Adam de Cardonnel’s <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Numismata Scotiæ</i>.
Those of Edward represent him in full face, with <i>Edw.
Ang.</i>; <i>Dus Hyb.</i>; and on the reverse of the different
coins, <i>Civitas Cantor</i>, <i>Civitas London</i>, <i>Civitas Lincoln</i>, and
almost all the mint-towns of England, with the cross extending
to the edge, and three roses in each quarter.
From the great number of these coins found in this part
of the country, it is probable they were deposited in the
earth by the soldiers of Edward, who had taken refuge in
these mountainous regions, when flying from the well-merited
indignation of the Scotch. They must have been
placed in the ground some time about the beginning of
the fourteenth century. Bruce having obtained the crown
in the year 1306, and relating, as they do, to a most interesting
period of our history, and which is embalmed
in the memory of every Scotsman, they are worthy of occupying
a place in the cabinets of the curious. A few of
them have been sent to the Museum of Edinburgh College.”&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i>
</p>
<p>
Within these few years also, a depôt was discovered at
Ascog, in the island of Bute, in which four thousand silver
pennies of Edward I. were found, most of them of the
London mintage.</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a name="Footnote_78" id="Footnote_78" href="#FNanchor_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>  It would be rather difficult to assign sufficient reasons
for the inferiority of the Scottish archers to those of
England; and perhaps it may be one of those popular errors,
which, being once promulgated, has passed unquestioned.
The ridicule which James I. has thrown upon a
certain portion of his countrymen, in his poem of Chryst’s
Kirk on the Green, has no doubt tended to confirm, or
perhaps to give rise to the opinion. The advice which
Robert Bruce gave his countrymen, always to attack and
disperse the English archers, as early in the engagement as
possible, is likewise quoted as an instance of the dread which
the Scots entertained for this description of their enemies’
force. But this advice most probably was suggested, more
from the vast multitudes of bowmen which the English
had it in their power to bring into the field, than from any
peculiar or individual advantage they possessed at their
weapon. The archers whom Bruce attacked and dispersed
at the battle of Bannockburn were chiefly Welch;&mdash;when
individual trials of skill occurred, any inferiority on the
part of the Scots was never very conspicuous; and there
appears no reason it should have been so. The attention
they bestowed on the art was at least equal to that of their
neighbours. This is evident, from the numerous wapenschaws
established all over the country. In the works of
Lindsay of Pittscottie, we have the following account of
a “waigeour of archerie,” between the Queen Dowager of
Scotland and her son James V.:&mdash;“In this yeir cam an
Inglisch ambassadour out of Ingland, callit Lord Williame,
ane bischope, and vther gentlmen, to the number
of thrie scoir horss, quhilkis war all able, wailled gentlmen,
for all kynd of pastime, as schotting, louping, wrastling,
runing, and casting of the stone. Bot they war weill
assayed in all these or they went home; and that be thair
awin provocatioun, and almost evir tint, quhill at the last
the kingis mother favoured the Inglismen, becaus shoe
was the king of Inglandis sister: and thairfoir shoe tuik
ane waigeour of archerie vpoun the Inglishmanis handis,
contrair the King hir sone, and any half duzoun Scottismen,
either noblmen, gentlmen, or yeamanes, that so many
Inglisch men sould schott againes them at riveris, buttis,
or prick bonnett. The King, heiring of this bonspeill
of his mother, was weill content. So thair was laid an
hundreth crounes and ane tun of wyne pandit on everie
syd. The ground was chosin in St Androis; the Scottis
archeris was thrie landit gentlmen and thrie yeamanes, to
witt, David Weimes of that ilk, David Arnott of that ilk,
and Mr Johne Wedderburne, viccar of Dundie. The
yeamanes was Johne Thomsone in Leith, Stevin Tabroner,
and Alexander Baillie, who was ane pyper, and
schott vondrous neir, and wan the vaigour from the Inglismen;
and thairefter went in to the toun and maid ane
banquett to the king and the queine, and the Inglisch
ambassadour, with the wholl tuo hundreth crounes, and
the tuo tunes of wyne. Albeit that the Inglismen confessed
that the Scottismen sauld have been fried of the
payment of that banqueitt, quhilk was so gorgeous that
it was of no les awaill than the said gold and wyne extended
to.”&mdash;<i>Chronicles of Scotland, by Lindsay of Pitscottie</i>,
vol. ii. p. 347, 348. It may also be observed, that
the value which the Scots set upon the quality of the
feathers used for their arrows, bespeaks a considerable
proficiency in the art. Those of the Earn appear, from
the following extract, to have been in the greatest request.
“In the west and north-west of Scotland, there is a
great repayring of the Erne, of a marvellous nature: the
people are very curious to catch him, and punze his wings,
that hee fly not. Hee is of a hudge quantity, and a ravenous
kind as the hawks, and the same qualitie. They
doe give him such sort of meat, in great quantity at once,
that hee lives contented therewith 14, 16, or 20 dayes,
and some of them a moneth. Their feathers are good for
garnishing of arrowes, for they receive no raine nor water,
but remaine alwayes of a durable estate, and uncorruptible.
The people doe use them either when they be a
hunting, or at warres.”&mdash;<i>A Memoriall of the most Rare
and Wonderful Things in Scotland.</i></p></div>

The following description of these dogs is from an old
writer, well acquainted with their character. “In Scotland
are dogs of marveylous condition, above the nature of
other dogs. The first is a hound of great swiftnesse, hardiness
and strength, fierce and cruell upon all wilde beasts,
and eger against thieves that offer their masters any violence.
The second is a rach, or hound, verie exquisite in
following the foote, (which is called drawing), whether it
bee of man or beast; yea, he will pursue any maner of
fowle, and find out whatsoever fish haunting the land, or
lurking amongst the rocks, specially the otter, by that excellent
sent of smelling wherewith he is indued. The
third sort is no greater than the aforesaid raches, in colour
for the most part red, with blacke spots, or else black
and full of red markes. These are so skilfull, (being used
by practise), that they will pursue a thiefe, or thiefe-stolne
goods, in the most precise maner, and finding the trespasser,
with great audacity they will make a race upon him,
or if hee take the water for his safegard, he shrinketh not
to follow him; and entring and issuing at the same places
where the party went in and out, hee never ceaseth to
range till he hath noysed his footing, and bee come to the
place wherein the thiefe is shrowded or hid. These dogs
are called Sleuth-hounds. There was a law amongst the
borderers of England and Scotland, that whosoever denyed
entrance to such a hound, in pursute made after felons
and stolne goods, should be holden as accessary unto the
theft, or taken for the selfe same thiefe.”&mdash;<i>Account of the
Red Deer and Wild Beasts in Scotland.</i></p></div>

every man was supplied with a horn, generally that of a
bullock, which he blew with vehemence, as he rushed on
to the charge. The horrible noise this occasioned had often
the effect of throwing the cavalry into confusion.

Wallace is said to have first approached the castle in
the disguise of an old beggar, with a patch over one eye,
and his sword concealed under his cloak. In this dress,
he entered into conversation with a woman engaged in
washing clothes in the Clyde. From her he learned, that
part of the garrison, amounting to about fifteen men, were
carousing in a “hostelrie” hard by, kept by two brothers
of the name of Watt. To this place he repaired, and
getting among them, it was not long before he discovered
that he was the subject of their conversation. Some, more
elated with the contents of the cup than their neighbours,
loudly expressed the satisfaction they would feel at having
a “bout” with the champion of the Scots; while he
who appeared to bear command among them, declared how
willingly and handsomely he would reward the man who
would bring them together. Wallace offered, for “sma’
hire,” to comply with their wishes; and rising, as if for
the purpose, drew forth his formidable weapon, and commenced
an attack upon the party, whom he was fortunate
enough, by his superior strength and dexterity, to
overpower and put to death. His horn was then sounded;
and his companions, quitting their lurking places, rallied
around him, and surprised the castle in the manner described.
The house where the above action is understood
to have taken place, is still to be seen in the village of
Crawford-John. It continues to be occupied by the descendants
of one of the two brothers above alluded to,
who was married to a woman named Dalziel, and whose
progeny continued to rent it as tenants, till about three
hundred years ago, when one of them, who was piper to
the proprietor, received a perpetual feu of the house, and
a small portion of land attached to it, for some piece of
service he had performed. The room in which the above
adventure is said to have occurred, is at the end of the
building, nearest to the ruins of Crawford Castle; and
the present occupant, Mr Dalziel, with praiseworthy attention,
endeavours to preserve, as much as possible, the
original appearance of the house. The ditch into which
the dead bodies of the English were thrown, is still pointed
out.</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a name="Footnote_91" id="Footnote_91" href="#FNanchor_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>  The family, from which Sir Bryce Blair is descended,
has come down till the present time. He was third in
succession from William de Blair, mentioned in a contract
between Ralph de Eglinton and the town of Irvine, in
1205; and who is said to have died in the reign of Alexander
II., betwixt the years 1214 and 1249, leaving a son also named
William, who, in a charter of Alexander III., is styled
<i>Willielmus de Blair</i>, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Dominus de eodem</i>, or of that Ilk.
This William left two sons; 1st Bryce, and 2d David. He
was succeeded by the eldest, Sir Bryce Blair of that Ilk,
who, having given umbrage to the English, by joining our
hero, was put to death in the treacherous manner described
in our history. His brother David, who succeeded to the
estates, had submitted to Edward, along with the aristocracy
in 1296. Though the head of this family was considered
as the chief of all the Blairs in Scotland, yet their
title was often called in question by the Blairs of Balthycock,
a family of great antiquity. The affair was at last
brought before James VI., who decided, that “<i>the oldest
man, for the time being, of either family should have the
precedency</i>.” It is probable that John Blair, who acted
as chaplain to Wallace, was a cadet of this family.</p></div>

was in the habit of carrying the banner of St Cuthbert,
it was only on extraordinary occasions that this
unwieldy ensign was displayed; and it is not likely,
that, amid the bustle of so unexpected an attack, they
could spare time to get it ready, even if the occasion had
been a proper one, it being chiefly reserved for high festivals.
As it had been brought into Scotland the preceding
year, it was very likely retained, along with that of
St John of Beverly, to grace the processions of the proud

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_101" id="Footnote_101" href="#FNanchor_101" class="fnanchor">101</a>  This person was the chief of the ancient and warlike
clan Gregor, and one of the few of the West Highland
chiefs who took a part in the struggle for the independence
of the country. He remained steady in his loyalty to Robert
Bruce, who he is said to have rescued from John of
Lorn at Dalreoch. On this occasion he was mounted on
a milk-white steed. He afterwards harboured the King in a
large cave near Cragcrastan, which is to this day called
“<i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">Uagh na riogh</i>”, or the <i>King’s Cave</i>, from which he crossed
over and met the Earl of Lennox at Lochlomond.
Malcolm fought at the Battle of Bannockburn, and is
said to have been the person who brought the relict of St
Fillan’s arm from the country of that name, then part of
his property, to King Robert’s chaplain, who very adroitly
passed it off for a miracle, and thereby excited the hopes
and stimulated the valour of the army. So sensible was
Bruce of this piece of service, that he founded a priory in
honour of the saint in Strathfillan in 1314. Malcolm was
much celebrated in the songs of the bards. He fought
under King Edward Bruce in Ireland; and having received
a wound at the battle of Dundalk, he retired home in
consequence; and as he never entirely recovered, he was
called ever after, “<i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">Mórfhear bacach</i>” or the lame lord.</p></div>

as it is to this day, by the name of <i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">Crag-an-àradh</i>, or the

deviation is extremely small, and more in the orthography
than the orthoepy. The West-Highlanders pronounce
<i xml:lang="gd" lang="gd">crag-an-àradh</i>, nearly as if spelled <i>craganari</i>. The difference
may have easily occurred in the act of transcribing.
The mode of crossing the ravine as above described, was
in use till the present road was made by government, when
a bridge was substituted for the less commodious expedient
of a ladder.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a name="Footnote_110" id="Footnote_110" href="#FNanchor_110" class="fnanchor">110</a>  William de Warren was the son of John, Earl of
Warren and Surrey (according to Dugdale), by Alice,
daughter of Hugh le Brun, Count of March, uterine
sister of Henry the Third. In 5th Edward I., he was
sent into Wales on the King’s business. In 22d Edward
I., he was employed in pressing ships in the southern and
western counties, and in cutting down timber for the use
of the Royal Navy, which was to rendezvous at Portsmouth.
In 25th Edward I., he was taken prisoner by
the Scots, on which occasion the King committed the care
of his lands to his own attorney, William de Berquey.
According to Dugdale, he had a claim, through his wife
Mary, to the Isle of Man; but Edward having reserved
the Island for his own use, it is uncertain what compensation,
or, if any, was made. He appears to have allowed
her, by the name of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Regina Manniæ, quondam uxor

2 hogsheads wine, 40 quarters wheat, and 40 of malt,
amounting to 31<i>l.</i> 6s. 8d., but on what account is not

indolence of the English general. The return of so considerable
a body of troops, on account of their not being

throw himself into the river, he replied, “It shall never
be said of me, that I did voluntarily drown myself. God
forbid, that such a dishonour should fall upon me, or any
Englishman;” and, setting spurs to his horse, rushed into
the thick of the battle, killing many of his opponents, and
was fast making his way to the bridge, when he was called
to by his nephew, who was wounded, to save him. “Get
up and follow me,” was the answer. “Alas! I am weak,
and cannot,” returned the other. Sir Marmaduke’s squire
dismounted, and placed him behind his uncle, who brought
him off in safety to Stirling Castle, where they both found

the burgesses of Stirling, and the tenants of the Abbey-Alands
at Cambuskenneth, were particularly active; and it
is supposed, that, from their behaviour on this occasion,
they were allowed to assume an allusion to the battle in
the town’s seal, which, after the date of the above transaction,
displayed on the obverse a bridge, composed of seven
arches; in the centre appeared a crucifix, on the south
side of which stand three soldiers with bows, (the national
weapon of the English), endeavouring to force the passage,

Bishop-Middleham, then a fortress of the first class, appears,
from the date of several charters, to have been Anthony
Bek’s chief residence within the county of Durham.
The reasons which led to this preference are obvious. Defended
by a morass on two sides, and by broken ground
to the north, the fortress presented an almost impregnable
stronghold during the wars of the Border, whilst Auckland
lay bare and defenceless, on the direct route of
Scottish invasion. It is no wonder that, in after times,
Middleham was deserted for the green glades of Auckland.

Of this black Hugh, take the following legendary account:&mdash;“Sir
Anthon Bek, Busshop of Dureme in the
tyme of King Eduarde, the son of King Henry, was the
maist prowd and masterfull Busshop in all England; and
it was com’only said that he was the prowdest Lord in
Christienty. It chanced that, emong other lewd persons,
this Sir Anthon entertained at his court one Hugh de
Pountchardon, that for his evill deeds and manifold robberies
had been driven out of the Inglische Court, and
had come from the southe to seek a little bread, and to
live by stalynge. And to this Hughe, whom also he imployed
to good purpose in the warr of Scotland, the Busshop
gave the lande of Thikley, since of him caulied
Thikley-Pountchardon, and also made him his chief huntsman.
And after, this blake Hugh dyed afore the Busshop:
and efter that the Busshop chasid the wild hart in
Galtres forest, and sodainly ther met with him Hugh de
Pontchardon that was afore deid, on a wythe horse; and
the said Hugh loked earnestly on the Busshop, and the
Busshop said unto him, ‘Hughe, what makethe thee
here?’ and he spake never word, but lifte up his cloke,
and then he shewed Sir Anton his ribbes set with bones,
and nothing more; and none other of the varlets saw him
but the Busshop only; and the said Hughe went his way,
and Sir Anton toke corage, and cheered the dogges; and
shortly efter he was made Patriarque of Hierusalem, and
he sawe nothing no moe; and this Hughe is him that the
silly people in Galtres doe call <i>Le gros Venour</i>, and he
was seen twice efter that by simple folk, afore that the
forest was felled in the tyme of Henry, father of King
Henry that now ys.”</p></div>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
